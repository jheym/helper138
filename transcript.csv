"08-29","0:03","all right so today uh we are going to start the first lecture"
"08-29","0:09","um introduction to Networks let me firstly discuss the structure of our class the very first chapter is"
"08-29","0:17","going to be um introduction to the networks okay then the second check beginning from the"
"08-29","0:24","second chapter we are going to discuss the uh application layer then transport layer the network layer and then finally"
"08-29","0:31","the link layer okay those are the four main layers we are going to cover in this class each chapter you can imagine"
"08-29","0:37","because we we have uh only these many chapters in this semester so we are"
"08-29","0:43","going to have super long chapters so be prepared for that uh in this chapter what we are going to discuss is"
"08-29","0:50","basically firstly we want to know what is internet and then the second thing we are going to discuss is what is a"
"08-29","0:57","protocol then after that we are going to discuss Network Edge Network call these"
"08-29","1:02","are very important definitions okay um and then we will discuss how to"
"08-29","1:08","measure the network basically what is the uh the performance of the network okay then we will discuss the security"
"08-29","1:16","part of uh Network this is this security part is uh is very basic okay very basic"
"08-29","1:25","um if you want to learn more you should probably take 154 class the networking and network security class to to learn"
"08-29","1:32","more okay and then we will discuss the layers I mentioned we will we will"
"08-29","1:37","discuss several layers in this class then why do we have layers what is the"
"08-29","1:43","functionality for each layer okay so what are the protocols containing this each layer then we will discuss that so"
"08-29","1:50","for history we will just skip that okay all right so then let's start the first"
"08-29","1:55","question what is an internet um if we take a Nas and both view I think"
"08-29","2:03","last time we did the discussion many of you mentioned notes and the links yeah"
"08-29","2:08","those are very important two things or two components that will compose the"
"08-29","2:14","internet okay so when we see knows basically we mean the computers the"
"08-29","2:20","devices right some of you mentioned servers pay attention servers is just"
"08-29","2:25","one type of note okay servers are although the the the same huge usually"
"08-29","2:32","this sounds like huge things right but actually servers are just irregular computers may they may have a more uh"
"08-29","2:40","computer power computation power they may have more storage Etc but they are"
"08-29","2:47","still like a Computing device okay so here we can see uh okay the servers is just a"
"08-29","2:54","type of device but in addition to the servers okay you can see this is one type in addition to the servers we may"
"08-29","3:01","have the PCS we may have a laptop we may have the smartphones we may have the"
"08-29","3:07","tablets and we may even have uh the smart devices okay what which we call as"
"08-29","3:14","we now we have a idea of Internet of Things you hear about iot again and"
"08-29","3:21","again right so what is iot iot is internet of things so here are the"
"08-29","3:26","things may refer to a lot of things okay later I'm going to show you a slide on this"
"08-29","3:33","um so that all those Computing devices as long as they as long as they are able"
"08-29","3:38","they can be connected to the internet then we call them as the nodes okay or"
"08-29","3:45","we calculate them as the hot okay the hots or the N devices okay and the"
"08-29","3:51","systems well these are all the possible names for this uh Computing devices and"
"08-29","3:56","usually these Computing devices are able to run the network applications okay so for example on your computer you may run"
"08-29","4:04","uh uh email okay Outlook so this is"
"08-29","4:10","actually later when we talk about the email service Union you will know this is actually the client program for email"
"08-29","4:17","service okay and then we need to have some kind of"
"08-29","4:23","server program on the email server okay similarly if you you're using a web"
"08-29","4:29","page using uh sorry not available"
"08-29","4:45","[Music]"
"08-29","5:06","okay in addition to that in addition to those Computing devices we also need"
"08-29","5:13","some kind of links or um cables or whatever to connect them"
"08-29","5:19","together okay so those are called communication links"
"08-29","5:25","so the communication links uh so far they can be either white links or"
"08-29","5:32","Wireless links okay so for for example we may have uh fiber we know this is"
"08-29","5:37","super fast and it has a very low error rate okay it's very reliable uh we may"
"08-29","5:44","also have copper um uh corporate cables right so those are"
"08-29","5:53","like uh wide links but we miss we may also have wireless links like radio"
"08-29","5:58","satellite okay those are all the wireless links um and for these links there is a very"
"08-29","6:06","important matter uh that is that that is used uh to show"
"08-29","6:12","the speed of the links so this is called transmission rate and this is this"
"08-29","6:18","transmission rate is later we will learn it is actually very important it will"
"08-29","6:23","um affect something we call a transmission delay okay so sometimes if"
"08-29","6:28","the transmission also has another name which is bandwidth I think you are all you all know the term bandwidth right"
"08-29","6:35","but what is uh what is the bandwidth the formal name is actually the transmission rate"
"08-29","6:41","um and this bandwidth if you have a bigger bandwidth then your your network"
"08-29","6:50","is faster what does this mean faster faster means you have less delays okay why"
"08-29","6:56","does higher transmission rate cause lower delays later uh I will show you I"
"08-29","7:02","will give you a formula for that okay then now we have the links connecting"
"08-29","7:07","the Computing devices that is this sufficient is this enough"
"08-29","7:15","you think about this if we have if we have the"
"08-29","7:23","um links and devices then Avida can we build a network on top of this only"
"08-29","7:32","so now we can imagine for example if we have most of you say no right so we say no in"
"08-29","7:39","the in the chat right we cannot we cannot we may we may"
"08-29","7:44","be able to build a very small network but we want we are not able to build a large area network"
"08-29","7:51","or will not be able to build a internet why you think about this if you only"
"08-29","7:57","have cables and all vehicle links or on the devices then if you have a computer let's say in"
"08-29","8:07","U.S and another computer in Europe then we have another one in Asia okay so now"
"08-29","8:15","if you want to connect these two then you need you need to have third direct links between these authorities three"
"08-29","8:22","computers apparently it's very hard okay first it's hard to use white links if you use"
"08-29","8:29","wireless links then you may you may need to have a very very very very powerful"
"08-29","8:36","um uh transmitter and receiver but usually that is not possible"
"08-29","8:42","okay even when you think about someone someone of you may say oh I can use"
"08-29","8:48","satellite satellite I I'll I'll uh explain this"
"08-29","8:53","later satellite is actually also itself is not able to directly connect to those"
"08-29","9:00","devices okay it needs to firstly connect to this kind of Tower okay and then the tower is"
"08-29","9:07","actually connected to the browser okay so that's why okay that's why this"
"08-29","9:13","these two things are not enough we need a third type of thing which is called"
"08-29","9:18","tacky switches okay package which is means routers and switches okay so this"
"08-29","9:27","kind of thing is use the two forward the package so as"
"08-29","9:32","you can see these devices are all connected to a router or switch"
"08-29","9:39","okay and then in the middle of the network we actually have a bunch of routers a lot of routers okay then we do"
"08-29","9:48","your level do not have direct link between two Computing devices actually those two compute devices when they talk"
"08-29","9:54","to each other they have to go through a lot of routers okay so which we call you"
"08-29","10:00","lyrical as a for example a path Okay so"
"08-29","10:07","um that is uh that is a uh the package which part okay this this packets which"
"08-29","10:13","are like the uh post offices if you think about uh the postal service so"
"08-29","10:19","those packages are like the postal offices at different um areas so they are they are able to"
"08-29","10:26","forward the uh packets or the letters for you okay"
"08-29","10:33","um and as I mentioned again some of you may think about the satellite so the"
"08-29","10:39","satellite okay the satellite in the sky is actually connected to a tower for us your"
"08-29","10:47","computer when you think about it for example some of you may think oh I'm using 4G or LT"
"08-29","10:53","uh when you use this kind of cellular network okay your phone is not connected"
"08-29","11:00","to the satellite directly because your phone is not that powerful enough okay"
"08-29","11:05","it's not that powerful it does not have the power to send signal directly to to"
"08-29","11:12","the uh to the satellite okay as a matter of fact your phone as is actually"
"08-29","11:20","connected to uh some of the towers okay so some of"
"08-29","11:25","the towers here um and then the towers"
"08-29","11:30","actually is connected to the uh satellite okay and then you may think"
"08-29","11:36","how then how could the towers be connected to the internet as you can see here the towers is actually connected to"
"08-29","11:42","a router okay that is how the signals are uh finally uh connected into the"
"08-29","11:51","internet so actually it's through a router all right okay so uh do remember I just"
"08-29","11:58","mentioned the Internet of Things okay so what are the things so we now have a lot of Internet"
"08-29","12:06","uh devices like for example you may have your picture from connect to the"
"08-29","12:11","Internet or you may have uh the refrigerator connected to the internet"
"08-29","12:16","okay so you may you may even have a toaster which is able to do a weather"
"08-29","12:23","forecast so we can have a lot of devices connected into the internet and now"
"08-29","12:30","smart devices are we have more and more varieties okay so maybe"
"08-29","12:36","um and now you can even for example you may for example have a smart clock which"
"08-29","12:41","is able to send some kind of alarm to maybe a coffee maker in the morning and"
"08-29","12:48","say hey a master has a waking up please make a copy for him or her so"
"08-29","12:55","um yeah so all those devices you can see are now kind of connected but of course"
"08-29","13:00","with those devices it connects with each other and you are actually exposing more"
"08-29","13:05","attack surface to the attackers so they are more they have more opportunities to"
"08-29","13:12","happen to your network that's something you need to pay attention to um I remember maybe one or two years ago"
"08-29","13:19","there was a incident actually uh taking advantage of the cameras so those"
"08-29","13:26","cameras actually all they all use the default password okay it's very easy to hack"
"08-29","13:34","into those cameras and then the attackers basically use those cameras to conduct a DDOS attack okay later we'll"
"08-29","13:42","explain more about this kind of uh DDOS attack"
"08-29","13:47","okay so um and that's the uh the the basic the basic components of network uh"
"08-29","13:55","in addition to that okay in addition to that we need something more as we mentioned"
"08-29","14:00","so we have the heart those Hardware right then the device is the links we"
"08-29","14:06","also have the uh the routers and switches like the packet switches okay"
"08-29","14:11","so is that enough no okay why because we"
"08-29","14:17","still need some kind of uh rules or standards for all those devices to"
"08-29","14:23","follow okay if we do not have any rules you can imagine you can imagine if we do"
"08-29","14:28","not have any rules then how could those devices understand each other right those are just the devices those they"
"08-29","14:36","are not human beings okay they can they cannot understand each other so that's why we also need something called"
"08-29","14:42","protocols okay those protocols usually control"
"08-29","14:48","um when to do the sending how can we do the sending those kind of things right how can we do the receiving when to do"
"08-29","14:55","the receiving so it can chose the sending and receiving of messages okay so for example you can see at least the"
"08-29","15:02","protocols here actually uh so this is a combination of"
"08-29","15:08","protocols from different layers okay we may basically for each layer we have"
"08-29","15:15","some protocols for example as a higher layer AS application layer women talk"
"08-29","15:22","about the emails the web services we may for at least for example you may know"
"08-29","15:27","HTTP right you heard about this a lot at least you see this in the URL right it's"
"08-29","15:33","sometimes you see HTTP sometimes you say https okay that's basically means"
"08-29","15:40","um the web service is using HTTP protocol okay of course"
"08-29","15:48","um this protocol adds up as application layer when it comes to lower layer you"
"08-29","15:53","you may have to use TCP protocol and that's transport layer when it comes to the network layer you may use IP"
"08-29","16:01","protocol so later we will learn this is called some this is called for example"
"08-29","16:07","we have HTTP here then we have TCP here we may have IP here okay so this thing is called a"
"08-29","16:16","protocol stack"
"08-29","16:23","okay so this is called a protocol stack and later we are going to spend quite"
"08-29","16:29","some time explaining this protocol stack um but for now you only need to know"
"08-29","16:35","okay we may use a bunch of protocols in the internet to control uh those DIY"
"08-29","16:41","those devices okay um and this Heroes Skype is uh is one uh"
"08-29","16:49","propriet protocol and 80211 is actually for wireless network okay for Wi-Fi"
"08-29","16:57","um and we may also have some internet standards okay so they are usually"
"08-29","17:02","documented in formats such as RFC RFC means request for comments and we may"
"08-29","17:09","also have ietf internet engineering task force for for the standards"
"08-29","17:16","okay then now let's take uh take a service view we just look at the nard"
"08-29","17:21","and nuts and both view which means we are looking at all those components okay now if we change our perspective if we"
"08-29","17:29","look at the service View um then basically the internet is uh is"
"08-29","17:36","the infrastructure that provides the services two applications okay we know the"
"08-29","17:44","internet is run it's uh I mean has a lot of different applications it is for"
"08-29","17:51","example we may have a web application uh email application you may play video"
"08-29","17:57","games right we may do social you may use social networks like Facebook every day"
"08-29","18:02","so then the internet is basically"
"08-29","18:07","providing the infrastructure to support those applications okay so you think"
"08-29","18:14","about this for example um if you are designing a new application"
"08-29","18:20","if one day you say oh I want to design application that can be used for"
"08-29","18:26","um for mobile phone okay um then when you design this application"
"08-29","18:34","you need to of course do the programming for this application to to implement"
"08-29","18:39","some of the functionalities right but when you do the programming for this"
"08-29","18:45","application do you need to consider the routers"
"08-29","18:51","do need to consider how to do the routine do you need to consider how to achieve"
"08-29","18:57","reliable debt transfer so for example if a packet is dropped"
"08-29","19:02","what what should you do you need to consider a vote"
"08-29","19:08","if you think more if you think more you actually you don't need to right thank you James for the response right so you"
"08-29","19:16","don't need to consider those you only need to consider oh I want to realize this functionality I want to have two"
"08-29","19:25","clients talking to each other for example okay um but you don't really need to consider"
"08-29","19:31","about the routers the switches the protocols of them and how to rely how to"
"08-29","19:40","achieve the reliable digital transfer protocol those kind of things so so you only need to focus the real"
"08-29","19:47","functionality for your application okay of course you may for example you"
"08-29","19:53","may call some apis okay you may call some function calls to use some of the"
"08-29","20:00","services provided by the internet for example later when we learned the spoki program assignment you will know"
"08-29","20:05","sometimes you need to call um call some functions to do to use TCP"
"08-29","20:13","sometimes you may use UDP okay and you don't need to know what the what's your"
"08-29","20:19","TCP is what UDP is you don't need to know for now there are just some protocols but what I mean here is uh you"
"08-29","20:27","only need to implement the the functionalities of the application you"
"08-29","20:33","don't need to implement the functionalities of the internet so internet is basically the"
"08-29","20:39","infrastructure that provides the services to support your application"
"08-29","20:44","okay this is like when you use Postal Service okay when you want to for example email"
"08-29","20:51","uh send a letter or gift to a friend you only need to"
"08-29","20:58","um write a letter or prepare a package right and then drop it to the postal"
"08-29","21:04","office or you can even have them to pick up okay but do you need to worry how"
"08-29","21:11","would this package arrive at New York how would they deliver this package you don't really worry about that right so"
"08-29","21:18","uh that is very similar okay so postal service is again also kind of"
"08-29","21:24","infrastructure that provides the services to you okay it's like that"
"08-29","21:30","um yes that's correct it's like the middleman yeah"
"08-29","21:36","um and then what is a protocol okay so we need to look further about"
"08-29","21:41","the protocol so for human being uh basically uh we also have our own"
"08-29","21:47","protocol for example if you uh have a question about something usually you say"
"08-29","21:52","oh you say hi and the other person say Hi and then you say I have a question uh"
"08-29","21:58","can you can you please help me answer that then the other person responds so we have some kind of implicit rules that"
"08-29","22:06","we follow right uh then it's the same thing for the network the network um because they are they are machine"
"08-29","22:12","they are not human so the communication activities have to be defined very"
"08-29","22:18","strictly okay otherwise um they are not able to communicate with"
"08-29","22:25","each other okay so those uh definition those those activities are actually"
"08-29","22:31","defined in the OR defined and manage it in the protocols okay so here you can"
"08-29","22:37","see this is a like a definition for protocol protocols Define the format order of"
"08-29","22:45","messages sent and received among the network entities and actions taken on message receipt transmission and receipt"
"08-29","22:51","okay so this is a very important definition and this may appear on the"
"08-29","22:57","test okay so in the midterm or final exam I may give you a test like this asking"
"08-29","23:04","what is the definition for protocol okay please pay attention to that"
"08-29","23:11","and if you look at this example on the left this is a human protocol the one person"
"08-29","23:18","say hi the other person say hi then uh the the female on the left is that got"
"08-29","23:23","the time and the other person say yes two o'clock okay uh then in networking is similar okay"
"08-29","23:32","it's similar for example here we have a server and a client okay this client may send a TCP"
"08-29","23:40","connection request this connection request is like a handshaking kind of thing okay it's like saying hi hi to"
"08-29","23:48","each other okay so the client personally say can I connect with you then the"
"08-29","23:54","server responds and say yes let's connect so after the connection is established then the client may say can"
"08-29","24:01","I get this as you can see this is actually a web page"
"08-29","24:07","okay this this can be a web page or maybe a file or whatever so this is URL"
"08-29","24:12","so then the server may say yes sure so then this is the file to you"
"08-29","24:17","okay so if this is a web page then this file is a web page"
"08-29","24:23","okay it's a HTML file then this file can be displayed on the"
"08-29","24:30","client as a web page on the client when I see on the client with me I mean the client program which means the Firefox"
"08-29","24:39","okay which means the Chrome those are those um web browsers okay so for now"
"08-29","24:47","you don't need to understand the details like when I say display this on the client program is that we don't need to"
"08-29","24:53","know that I I'll spend quite some time explaining the server"
"08-29","24:58","and client uh the client and server model so now we don't need to know you"
"08-29","25:04","only need to know oh okay there's two machines are actually communicating each with each other okay so uh one is making"
"08-29","25:12","a request the other one is serving uh the the client or the first machine"
"08-29","25:20","the next topic we are going to discuss is the network Edge okay"
"08-29","25:25","so what is Network Edge Network Edge basically includes those things we see"
"08-29","25:30","here the end systems which means n devices the access networks and the links okay"
"08-29","25:38","so in the network Edge in the network Edge"
"08-29","25:44","we are talking about those machines okay those hosts clients or servers okay"
"08-29","25:53","those horse or those devices okay that's the edge and you may ask okay if"
"08-29","26:01","that's the edge then what is the core okay so Network core"
"08-29","26:08","is purely the routers the interconnected routers okay so as you can see here we"
"08-29","26:16","can see this approach"
"08-29","26:22","this part is the code okay you can see you only see routers"
"08-29","26:28","there that is the core or you can think uh you can also view"
"08-29","26:34","for example you can sometimes we also view these ad vouchers they are they are"
"08-29","26:39","in the edge okay so we may say okay this car is the code both are fine okay it's"
"08-29","26:44","not it's not important so both are fine but at least you know okay this part at least you know this"
"08-29","26:51","part is the code okay so there are purely purely ruptures"
"08-29","26:59","nothing else nothing else keep this in mind and then the network Edge includes"
"08-29","27:06","the remaining things like the horse okay so for example here the mobile"
"08-29","27:12","phone is belongs to the edge this computer the PC laptop belongs to the"
"08-29","27:18","edge okay so some of you may think how about the servers"
"08-29","27:23","okay I know in your mind in your mindset probably service is something huge is a"
"08-29","27:29","huge Center kind of thing okay uh and later you will learn actually when we do"
"08-29","27:35","our own programming you will learn server maybe certain way to just steal a"
"08-29","27:41","piece of code okay it's just a piece of code which sits on the machine"
"08-29","27:49","okay then the machine can be a regular machine for example your computer your"
"08-29","27:55","PC can can work as a service it's a absolutely fine okay the server doesn't need to be"
"08-29","28:03","a huge Center okay but of course sometimes the servers do belong to a huge Center"
"08-29","28:10","especially for those huge companies like Google Amazon okay they need to have"
"08-29","28:16","their own servers they may have a center to host the service okay but you may get"
"08-29","28:23","confused you may think oh does the server belong to the Core or the app what do you think"
"08-29","28:30","do you think the servers belong to the ad or the core so that's something you need to pay attention the servers no matter how big"
"08-29","28:38","they are okay no matter if they belong to the data center or not they are they"
"08-29","28:44","still belong to the edge Network Edge why because no matter how huge they are"
"08-29","28:50","they are still Computing devices okay"
"08-29","28:57","they are still like computers okay so that's why they still belong to"
"08-29","29:04","the network Edge and as we said in the network core the network code contains"
"08-29","29:11","only only routers okay only routers nothing else"
"08-29","29:17","yes this question are they are the servers just bigger computers"
"08-29","29:24","as I said the servers are actually just a piece of code okay this piece of code May sit on a"
"08-29","29:33","regular computer like your PC it's okay it's fine your PC can be a server or it"
"08-29","29:39","may sit in a much bigger computer with much powerful memory"
"08-29","29:45","computing power Etc okay oh it belongs to a data center it's"
"08-29","29:51","also fine but anyway it's just a piece of code does this make sense now okay okay good"
"08-29","29:58","um so pay attention and this may be a test problem so in the test I may give"
"08-29","30:03","you for example a true or false question or just a short answer question I may ask you I may say the servers belong to"
"08-29","30:11","the network code you know this is this statement correct actually this is a force okay pay"
"08-29","30:17","attention to that and then in the network Edge we may also have access Networks okay so what is accessible"
"08-29","30:23","networks Access Network means the network that is used to access"
"08-29","30:30","Internet okay so for example here we actually have three types of access"
"08-29","30:36","Networks mobile network"
"08-29","30:41","okay home network or institutional Network"
"08-29","30:48","prayer all belong to access Networks so for example when you are at home you are"
"08-29","30:54","using home network that is Access Network can you for example you can see you are using your home network you connect it"
"08-29","31:00","to this browser and then when you are at the um"
"08-29","31:05","maybe when you are on campus okay when for all when you are you find a job for example you work for a company"
"08-29","31:12","then you may use some um institutional Network"
"08-29","31:17","okay bigger or Enterprise Network okay so those kind of networks are also one"
"08-29","31:24","type of Access Network so your machine is connected to some switches or routers"
"08-29","31:31","and then finally connected to the internet okay or if you are driving uh or if you are"
"08-29","31:38","in the outside okay then you may use mobile network so mobile network in this case"
"08-29","31:45","as I mentioned your machine your device is actually connected to the tower first"
"08-29","31:51","sometimes we call this Tower as base station is connected to the space station and"
"08-29","31:57","then further connected to this router here and then this router is further"
"08-29","32:04","connected to the internet so this is called mobile network and then this is"
"08-29","32:09","also one type of Access Network so then um we have explained this how to connect"
"08-29","32:16","the end devices to a router we can use"
"08-29","32:21","either whole network we call as also as residential Network okay or"
"08-29","32:27","institutional Network or mobile Access Network okay so we can use those uh Network to connect to these ad routers"
"08-29","32:36","so these are all ad routers okay"
"08-29","32:43","this one is also Edgewater and this one is also eye drops so you can see the"
"08-29","32:48","edge router is actually used to connect the access network and the internet"
"08-29","32:55","core okay the internet code um so you need to keep in mind here uh when"
"08-29","33:04","we see Access Network the access network me have different bandwidth okay so"
"08-29","33:10","sometimes depends width is higher than you have faster speed if the bandwidth is lower than you have slower speed okay"
"08-29","33:17","and also um the link may be shared or maybe"
"08-29","33:22","dedicated for now you don't need to know this later we are going to spend quite some time explaining explaining this"
"08-29","33:29","okay all right so then let's talk let's"
"08-29","33:34","continue to discuss a little bit more about the access network let's think about the exact Network"
"08-29","33:39","for the access network uh if we want to build this how would you build this you"
"08-29","33:45","think about this I think last time I'm going to the discussion some of you mentioned this uh"
"08-29","33:52","mentioned this excellent point so since we already have some kind of structure"
"08-29","33:58","there for example we already have telephony Network right so in the in the old days we all have we do not use"
"08-29","34:05","mobile phone actually we every every home uh has a telephone at home right so we"
"08-29","34:11","have the telephone Network then at the very beginning when people firstly design the internet"
"08-29","34:17","um they will think oh okay let's let's directly use the infrastructure from the telephone Network okay that's why as you"
"08-29","34:25","can see um at a home okay at home we may have a"
"08-29","34:31","telephone we may have a computer okay then you think about this"
"08-29","34:38","um the telephone Network the telephone can be connected to the network directly"
"08-29","34:44","but the computer cannot why because it is using a different type of"
"08-29","34:50","signal which cannot be understand by the telephone Network so that's why we need"
"08-29","34:57","some kind of a model in between okay so the functionality of"
"08-29","35:03","modem is actually to convert the signal or the digital signal zeros and ones"
"08-29","35:10","from the computer into the signals that can be understand by the telephone Network so that is the"
"08-29","35:18","function of modem of course it can also do the reverse transform which means when the when the signal comes back"
"08-29","35:26","okay then it can also transfer convert the signals from the telephone Network"
"08-29","35:32","into the detail signal that can be understand by the computer okay so that"
"08-29","35:37","is this one and then you can see there is also splitter the splitter here is to use is used to split the signals into"
"08-29","35:45","two parts Y is going to the telephone the other one is going to computer okay"
"08-29","35:52","and you can see this is a one home and then we may have the other home a lot of"
"08-29","35:58","homes they are actually all connected together uh they are all connected"
"08-29","36:04","finally to some kind of central office in this central office we may have DSL"
"08-29","36:10","access multiplexer okay and then finally this multiplexer is connected to the"
"08-29","36:17","internet to the routers here okay so this is actually the design of"
"08-29","36:24","the very old days um internet it is using the digital"
"08-29","36:32","subscriber line okay which is a part of the the telephone Network okay"
"08-29","36:39","um at that time the speed is actually slow okay it's not very fast because you"
"08-29","36:46","think about this the telephone Network for that the speed is really slow okay"
"08-29","36:52","any special name for the Upstream transmission rate the Upstream which"
"08-29","36:58","means um from home to upload to the internet the speed is usually smaller than 2.5"
"08-29","37:05","Mach BPS so Mega BPS BPS means beat pure"
"08-29","37:11","seconds okay um and then the uh Downstream"
"08-29","37:19","transmission rate which is the downloading speed is usually faster it's smaller than"
"08-29","37:25","um 24 megabits per second okay"
"08-29","37:31","um so Alex is asking is this multiplexer similar to the one in CPU architecture"
"08-29","37:39","um so this multiplexer is uh actually used to"
"08-29","37:45","um thank you actually a sign the packets or signals"
"08-29","37:51","to different home home networks okay and"
"08-29","37:57","later we are going to learn more about this so the multiplexer is like a Friday"
"08-29","38:02","for example at home your parents okay make may receive a lot of letters"
"08-29","38:09","letters from letters for you and for your siblings okay"
"08-29","38:15","um for your browsers sorry brother and sisters Etc and then"
"08-29","38:21","your parents need to say hey Alex this is your letter and then uh maybe another"
"08-29","38:27","and then say to a sister let me say hey this is your letter so basically assign"
"08-29","38:32","the letters to different person that is for multiplexing and later we are going to more learn more about oh this is"
"08-29","38:38","called D multiplexing for example uh and then we also have multiplexing okay"
"08-29","38:44","multiplexing is like collecting the letters from all of you and then send it to the uh the the postal office it's"
"08-29","38:52","like that okay um so here's DSL multiplexer and this"
"08-29","38:59","this is actually like assigning the signal to different uh home networks"
"08-29","39:05","okay is there any server or Edge components"
"08-29","39:12","in the telephony network any server or Edge component this is a great question"
"08-29","39:18","so um so here the edge components we also have the computers they are this"
"08-29","39:23","belong to the edge it's similar so you can see uh these computers no"
"08-29","39:28","matter how it is connected finally it eventually connected to the routers okay"
"08-29","39:34","so here the routers are still the core and then we may we have those computer"
"08-29","39:39","itself belonging to the edge okay growing to the edge and of course"
"08-29","39:45","here when we we are kind of zoomed out and let you see the details for example in the edge you need to you need to have"
"08-29","39:51","some kind of modem okay this is actually built upon the DSL and later we will see"
"08-29","39:57","if it's built upon the cable it's similar things okay"
"08-29","40:02","um and then do we have several of course we have servers okay so for example we"
"08-29","40:07","may have Google's computer here Google server here the web server for Google we"
"08-29","40:15","may have the web server from CSUS server okay of course these are just web"
"08-29","40:22","servers and you may also have email several files server again service a lot of servers okay so they are all"
"08-29","40:28","connected in some way to the browsers okay"
"08-29","40:34","then this is the DSL and after that we uh after some"
"08-29","40:40","development we finally realized that the telephone network is not not fast enough because it's usually it only transfer it"
"08-29","40:48","always only uh yes um transfer the digital sorry the the"
"08-29","40:54","audio signals right so it's not fast enough and then after we had TVs and"
"08-29","41:02","then we know okay the cable network is much more powerful than the telephone Network because in cable network we can"
"08-29","41:09","hold videos videos basically contain both images and also the audios right so"
"08-29","41:17","a video is basically composed of images and audios"
"08-29","41:22","and then we all know the video actually has much bigger capacity right uh I mean"
"08-29","41:30","and then the cable network are much faster than the telephone Network that's why eventually uh we decided to switch"
"08-29","41:38","our infrastructure from DSL to cable but you can think about this even if you"
"08-29","41:45","are using cable still the signal types are different we still need a modem to convert the"
"08-29","41:54","signals from computer into the signals that can be accepted by the cable network"
"08-29","41:59","okay so that's why you in your lane in your home network I guess most of you"
"08-29","42:05","know oh okay we have a router you can probably guess what the router is used for but we also in addition to the round"
"08-29","42:12","trip we also need a modem then what is the modem used for right now you know"
"08-29","42:18","okay the modem is you basically use the for converting the signals and also we"
"08-29","42:23","need a splitter okay the splitter is used to split the signals okay so you"
"08-29","42:28","can see this is an example of the home network and all those home networks are"
"08-29","42:35","connected to a Mainline this main line is actually finally converted to the"
"08-29","42:41","keyboard hadn't um so because here there is actually a problem because there are multiple home"
"08-29","42:48","networks connecting to this main line as you can see here then there is a problem the problem is"
"08-29","42:57","um how can we accommodate the signals from different home networks"
"08-29","43:03","right if they all want to transmit something then how can we allow them to transmit at the"
"08-29","43:10","same time then this this is actually uh what we call as a multiple access problem and"
"08-29","43:17","later we are going to especially in the link layer we are going to dedicate some time to discuss that the protocols for"
"08-29","43:24","multiple access okay for now you uh you only need to know we actually have"
"08-29","43:29","different different methods to split the signals or to split"
"08-29","43:35","the entire uh bandwidth to different home networks okay"
"08-29","43:42","for example here you can see for this cable for this one cable we may have"
"08-29","43:47","multiple Channel nodes okay we may have here you can see we have actually nine"
"08-29","43:53","channels then the first five the first six channels are for the video"
"08-29","43:58","it's for the caliber okay and then we have two signals two channels for the"
"08-29","44:06","data and one channel for the control so um then for each Channel you can see"
"08-29","44:11","both channels one two six even if they are all for the video but"
"08-29","44:18","they still have different frequency right low frequency high frequency so"
"08-29","44:24","for this kind of a um method we call this frequency division multiplexing"
"08-29","44:31","okay that means the different channels transmit the signals in different"
"08-29","44:36","frequency bands okay so then in this way we can tell uh"
"08-29","44:41","the we can we can distinguish the signals from different channels okay"
"08-29","44:47","any questions so far okay"
"08-29","44:53","then um we can use for example we can use for this Main"
"08-29","44:59","Line we can use a High Hybrid fiber coax to do that usually pay attention uh the bandwidth"
"08-29","45:07","the speed is is actually a symmetric for Downstream transmission rate and"
"08-29","45:13","Upstream transmission rate this is actually very very common usually because most of the users are"
"08-29","45:19","downloading okay uploading is usually very I would say we have less"
"08-29","45:24","opportunity to upload usually so that's why the downloading speed is really much"
"08-29","45:30","faster than the uploading speed okay or we can see the downstream transmission rate is much higher than Upstream"
"08-29","45:39","transmission rate okay the transmission rate we know it also has a very well known name it's called bandwidth"
"08-29","45:51","as I mentioned again see how it might process problem okay what if we have multiple users they"
"08-29","45:59","all want to send some signals transmit signal at the same time then they have come some kind of computation to compete"
"08-29","46:06","for for this uh available uh bandwidth here in the main line then"
"08-29","46:12","this is the multi-process network so we will discuss that later that means"
"08-29","46:18","the homes actually share the access network to the cable Head end okay"
"08-29","46:24","all right um if we take a closer look at the home network"
"08-29","46:29","you can see here is to and from the head end of the central office then we here"
"08-29","46:37","we have the cable modem all the DSL modem depending which kind of network"
"08-29","46:42","you are using and then we also have the voucher"
"08-29","46:48","here the router is usually now the router is actually very Advanced"
"08-29","46:53","originally um in the old days the routers are just router they are just responsible for"
"08-29","46:59","routine but gradually routers integrated the functionality of firewall also okay"
"08-29","47:05","you may ask why how can we integrate firewall why can we increase integrate"
"08-29","47:10","the firewind router if you think about firewall firewall is like a filter okay"
"08-29","47:16","it allows the traffic uh allows specific traffic to come in"
"08-29","47:22","and deny some of the traffic okay so we use basically do some rules to Define"
"08-29","47:28","um which traffic can come in which traffic can will be denied so especially if you think about this for example now"
"08-29","47:37","if you want to refuse the traffic from a certain IP address then you can say okay"
"08-29","47:43","if the source IP address is from this this address a for example then all the"
"08-29","47:52","track traffic will be denied that means every time if there is a packet comes in"
"08-29","47:57","then we will check the IP address the source IP address for that package if"
"08-29","48:02","that packet is from a package is from the address we don't like then we just"
"08-29","48:08","deny that package we refuse to pass this to the destination computers"
"08-29","48:14","okay so that's how the file will work the reason we can combine firewall and"
"08-29","48:20","router is because actually all the traffic needs to go through the"
"08-29","48:26","router first and then go to the destination computers that's why we can"
"08-29","48:32","actually filter the traffic here at the router okay and that is another thing"
"08-29","48:37","that is called Network address translation I don't want to spend more time here discussing that we will also"
"08-29","48:46","dedicate some time discuss this but uh just to let you know the router can also"
"08-29","48:51","certify that functionality it's basically trans I would say translate the network address from public address"
"08-29","48:59","to private address or from private address to public address okay"
"08-29","49:04","so those are the solar functions for the router"
"08-29","49:09","and then here we also have this this is these are called the wireless access"
"08-29","49:14","point okay most of the time you will say oh that's how the router look like yes"
"08-29","49:21","that's exactly how the router look like at your home usually actually we combine"
"08-29","49:27","this wireless access point with the router okay these two are combined in"
"08-29","49:33","one single box that means your router your router also has the wireless access"
"08-29","49:39","point that's why you see this device at your home okay and in addition to that you will sometimes if you do not use"
"08-29","49:46","wireless you do not use Wi-Fi you can see this computer is using Wi-Fi okay so for the other computers they are"
"08-29","49:54","connected to the router directly with the cable okay so then that is called"
"08-29","50:02","that is usually called the ethernet The Wider ethernet okay and we may also have"
"08-29","50:08","the wife the phones connecting to the uh what is success point"
"08-29","50:14","so that is about the home network"
"08-31","1:31","they're mean the same thing you really okay in the Enterprise Network"
"08-31","1:36","the protocol we use is usually ethernet of course we have some like"
"08-31","1:44","wireless network okay but most of the PCS servers are connected via cables"
"08-31","1:51","okay the my cables the protocol guys version is"
"08-31","1:56","the ethernet okay and in the Enterprise networks usually we firstly we have the"
"08-31","2:02","servers okay the servers are some machines that are"
"08-31","2:10","dedicated to provide some service to the you to the clients to the users okay depending"
"08-31","2:17","on different type of services we call them different servers but again"
"08-31","2:23","as I mentioned the memory C servers the servers are the computers firstly they"
"08-31","2:29","are the computers and also we refer to the server program sometimes you'll be you may even for"
"08-31","2:36","example install you may even install one sorry"
"08-31","2:42","you may install multiple server program on one machine okay so"
"08-31","2:49","here for example"
"08-31","3:10","foreign"
"08-31","3:17","so if your machine your physical machine is powerful enough and if you're if you"
"08-31","3:24","only serve a small group of people small group of users then sometimes don't even"
"08-31","3:30","need multiple physical machines you can install multiple server programs on one"
"08-31","3:37","machine and then use that one machine to service the server that is also possible okay of course you can also for example"
"08-31","3:44","deploy a number of virtual machines in one physical"
"08-31","3:49","um in one physical machine and then each washing machine serves as a server that is also possible so you can see there"
"08-31","3:56","are multiple ways of implementing this so then in the future when you talk"
"08-31","4:02","about servers we think about this they you don't always think that those servers are big machines sitting in a"
"08-31","4:09","large roomy okay uh we may have a rack of servers it's not like that it may be"
"08-31","4:15","just a regular computer okay depending on how many users you are serving"
"08-31","4:20","and then those servers again those servers they may for example you be used"
"08-31","4:26","as mail servers they need to be used as web servers um there are multiple servers in one"
"08-31","4:32","organization usually and then in addition to that of course we need to have some pieces right"
"08-31","4:38","so these are the pieces personal computers um those personal computers are usually"
"08-31","4:44","by used by regular users okay of course we have multiple client programs"
"08-31","4:50","installed on those client programs are corresponding to the server program for example if you have an email server"
"08-31","4:57","okay then you have email clients so so for example on these emotions you may"
"08-31","5:03","have Outlook you may have um Apple Mail okay so that you can check"
"08-31","5:09","emails or you can even use the web browser to check emails okay and then if"
"08-31","5:15","you have web server then on those clients you may have web web clients"
"08-31","5:20","okay web service clients like the Firefox the Chrome they are all kinds programs okay so those are the PCS and"
"08-31","5:29","then we need to connect those machines together okay so if this is a small"
"08-31","5:34","Network then we can directly connect those machines to one voucher so this"
"08-31","5:40","router we call it as a ad router"
"08-31","5:47","the reason we call this as agile Trace because it will be connected to the"
"08-31","5:52","internet directly okay it helps to connect this entire Access Network to"
"08-31","5:59","the internet that's why we call it address if this network is big"
"08-31","6:06","okay sometimes we are not able to connect those machines directly to one router we may connect them to"
"08-31","6:14","the switch first and then never switch to the router okay so this is a very"
"08-31","6:20","very common and later we will learn the difference between switch and the router"
"08-31","6:25","well now we don't need to know okay so this is like a basic structure for Enterprise Network or we call it"
"08-31","6:31","institutional Network um this is a very commonly used in"
"08-31","6:37","companies universities organizations governments okay and then depending on the size of the"
"08-31","6:45","network and the requirements the demands of the network the benefit of these networks may be different we may have 10"
"08-31","6:51","megaps 100 megaps or two even 10 gigabits transmission rates or bandwidth"
"08-31","6:58","okay so that's the structure so then let's"
"08-31","7:03","continue to look at the mobile network or we could add code column sometimes as"
"08-31","7:08","widest extent works so for our wireless access networks we have usually two"
"08-31","7:13","types one type is called the wireless lens Wireless local area networks"
"08-31","7:18","another type is called Wireless ones okay wide area network okay wide area"
"08-31","7:27","Network"
"08-31","7:32","okay this is a one so for lens we are usually uh they are"
"08-31","7:39","the line is basically means local area network"
"08-31","7:51","okay so Wireless lens are usually very small range okay uh it covers a small"
"08-31","7:58","area it's usually within a building for example you can have uh it can cover 100"
"08-31","8:04","feet and though protocol use is usually the Wi-Fi okay"
"08-31","8:10","or we we call it 80 to 11. so the transmission rate is usually very high"
"08-31","8:17","so that's for land and for what for one it's a usually covers much much wider"
"08-31","8:25","area so usually those ones are using the cellular network okay we'll refer to"
"08-31","8:31","those as cellular network and the speed are usually lower than Wi-Fi okay much lower than Wi-Fi"
"08-31","8:39","um and now we have we have 3G 4G LTE okay and even 5G is"
"08-31","8:45","coming so that is the one and again pay attention when we talk"
"08-31","8:51","about with the cellular network okay those devices these devices"
"08-31","8:57","do not connect to satellite in directly okay they have to be connected to a"
"08-31","9:02","tower first and then Tower is connected to the router to foot and then further to the internet okay so they are not"
"08-31","9:10","connected to the satellite directly pay attention to that so with those in your mind now I want to"
"08-31","9:16","talk some talk about something um that's how the host hits and the package"
"08-31","9:23","to the link okay we want to talk more a little bit more about the bandwidth now"
"08-31","9:28","because we in the past in the networks index all the different type of assets access networks we talk about the"
"08-31","9:35","bandwidth right and we said the bandwidth will affect the speed of the network or the speed of"
"08-31","9:41","transmission then how can the benefit affect that okay so"
"08-31","9:46","we want to know so now let's see this is a computer or a"
"08-31","9:52","horse so this computer is trying to send the"
"08-31","9:57","package out okay so now we have two packets packet one and package two okay each"
"08-31","10:04","packet has L Beats lbs okay and we want"
"08-31","10:09","to send each packet out we know the link transmission rate or"
"08-31","10:14","what we call as bandwidth foreign"
"08-31","10:24","then now if we want to send this l b or lbs out into the link"
"08-31","10:34","so it's like we are pushing we are pushing the data"
"08-31","10:40","in this packing one into the cable and if you imagine this cable as a"
"08-31","10:47","if you imagine this cable as a pipe okay and if you imagine the data as water"
"08-31","10:55","then we are trying to push the water into the water pipe okay of course if you have a white water"
"08-31","11:04","pipe then we can push it out much faster right but if you have a very narrow very"
"08-31","11:11","narrow pipe then we can push the data very very slow"
"08-31","11:17","okay then we may take a longer time to push all the water into the water pipe"
"08-31","11:22","so this makes sense to you the width of the pipe reference the benefit so when I see a white uh wider"
"08-31","11:30","pipe I mean a higher bandwidth uh narrower pipe I mean a lower bandwidth"
"08-31","11:37","so now if you think about the time we used to push the data or push the water"
"08-31","11:43","into the water pipe okay it's like the time we used to push"
"08-31","11:49","the data into the link okay so this time we call it as"
"08-31","11:56","transmission delay okay the time is called packet transmission"
"08-31","12:02","delay"
"08-31","12:29","okay the time spent to push the data into the link like like the time spent to pushing the water into the pipe"
"08-31","12:36","now how do we Define this transmission delay the transmission delay is defined by L over r k l divided by R so L is the"
"08-31","12:45","number of bits in this packet and R is the transmission rate or the bandwidth"
"08-31","12:50","okay so all you can see is how many bits we can take per second then if the error"
"08-31","12:58","is bigger then the delay is is smaller that means if we have a wider pipe or if"
"08-31","13:05","we have a higher bandwidth then we spend less time transmitting the data also in"
"08-31","13:11","the data out okay does this make sense foreign"
"08-31","13:21","okay so this is a very important this slide is very important"
"08-31","13:28","this may appear on the test and we are going to spend more time actually discussing all the different"
"08-31","13:34","type of delays and transmission delay is one very important type okay one more"
"08-31","13:40","important type and pay attention this time is simply the transmission delay"
"08-31","13:46","it's simply the time you spent on pushing the data out"
"08-31","13:51","okay it actually happens here between the computer the host and or the"
"08-31","13:56","the link okay um question has a time a question are"
"08-31","14:03","packing the same amount of bits each time that's a great question"
"08-31","14:09","I'll say no okay uh the packets have different amounts of bits actually in"
"08-31","14:15","reality okay depending on different protocols um so each packet may have different"
"08-31","14:22","size and even sometimes if one packet has a work it's very big okay especially"
"08-31","14:28","in ipv4 in the ordering four of Internet Protocol sometimes if one pack is too"
"08-31","14:35","big when it comes to a very narrow Network which uh very very narrow"
"08-31","14:41","let's say very uh come to a link with a small bandwidth and also maybe"
"08-31","14:47","especially this link may only allow small size or package going uh going to"
"08-31","14:54","the road then sometimes we even break this one big pack into smaller parts so"
"08-31","14:59","this is called fragmentation and we will learn that later but as you can see as you can see it's"
"08-31","15:06","like when you drive on the road sometimes the road are very wide they can they allow big trucks going through"
"08-31","15:13","but sometimes the roads are very narrow and they allow only small cards to go"
"08-31","15:19","through so it's like that the the amount of bits are different that's great"
"08-31","15:24","question question and other questions"
"08-31","15:30","okay yeah keep this formula in your mind is very important"
"08-31","15:36","okay so then let's continue to discuss the physical media and this part is not very important it's just like introduce"
"08-31","15:43","you to different types of uh Medias we may use for the network okay so the"
"08-31","15:50","physical media basically will carry the Beats from the transmitter to the"
"08-31","15:55","receiver okay the base will rock it between the transmission receiver"
"08-31","16:01","then the physical link will carry those beats those physical colleagues can even"
"08-31","16:07","can be either guided or unguided usually guided means cables okay we may have for"
"08-31","16:13","example different type of cables copper coax fiber and then for unguided media"
"08-31","16:20","we may have um Wi-Fi okay we may have radio for example okay so basically the signals"
"08-31","16:26","project propagate freely into all directions it's like that okay"
"08-31","16:32","so here on the right side you can see the twisted pair I think here you are probably very familiar with this I I saw"
"08-31","16:39","this a lot especially in the old days now now it's not very not very common"
"08-31","16:45","obviously um but yeah you you see this a lot actually"
"08-31","16:52","um so this is actually this twist pair is made with copper okay and then you"
"08-31","16:58","may also see the coaxial cable okay the classic cable can transmit the signals"
"08-31","17:05","bi-directionally the signals can go two directions um and then you may also see fiber so"
"08-31","17:13","fiber is really really high speed and usually the it has two advantages"
"08-31","17:19","actually one is high speed second one inside has a very low average okay so"
"08-31","17:25","that's why um later we talk we may talk about error correction error detection and error"
"08-31","17:32","correction let me talk about the reliability transfer usually if you are using like Wi-Fi you have to really pay"
"08-31","17:38","attention to the error Direction detection and the correction but if you are using fiber you don't really need to"
"08-31","17:45","pay attention to pay a lot of attention to that because the low the average is"
"08-31","17:51","very low okay um and then for what is networks we have"
"08-31","17:59","radio so the signals are carried uh basically uh in electron magnetic Spectrum okay so"
"08-31","18:07","the signals can go to different directions and also this can be a"
"08-31","18:12","bi-directional that means transmitter consent to receive and receiver can send it to the transmitter and sometimes they"
"08-31","18:20","may sometimes the signal may go two directions and then they may meet in the"
"08-31","18:25","middle so this is for this kind of thing we call this as clearance this is also uh something we need to to address"
"08-31","18:33","actually networking okay uh the I would say the drawbacks of radio is um it may"
"08-31","18:40","be affected by multiple factors like you may have reflection okay you may experience obstruction by"
"08-31","18:48","objects like for example if especially if you're in New York or if San"
"08-31","18:54","Francisco when where you see the high buildings and everywhere then in that"
"08-31","18:59","case the mobile the signals can be uh really bad okay and then you may also"
"08-31","19:04","have interference between signals that's another thing you need to pay attention"
"08-31","19:10","um we also have different uh radio link types as we mentioned before we have microwave micro reactive we didn't"
"08-31","19:17","mentioned but we mentioned in the line right Wi-Fi so we may have white microwave Wi-Fi cellular network and"
"08-31","19:24","even the satellite Network okay so light signals so those are the things"
"08-31","19:30","um about the physical media for this part you don't need to"
"08-31","19:35","remember you don't need to um these are just knowledge for you to"
"08-31","19:41","know like more like the introduction and and in the test I will not asking"
"08-31","19:46","you about the like the fiber coax Etc no"
"08-31","19:51","don't worry about that the next thing we are going to talk about is the network core so now we focus now we're called"
"08-31","19:58","again in your mind when we see core we mean the routers okay pay attention to"
"08-31","20:03","that so let's look at the core"
"08-31","20:12","so the network code is basically a mesh of interconnected routers"
"08-31","20:17","we we the routers we also call them Packy switch okay uh them basically what"
"08-31","20:25","will happen in the network is if we have if we think"
"08-31","20:31","about different layers again I'm talking about layers because we can never go around with layers"
"08-31","20:37","so"
"08-31","20:50","okay so in now working we have multiple layers and now"
"08-31","20:55","application layer you all know right so application we have those applications like emails webs Etc and then eventually"
"08-31","21:03","it will come down to network layer so the routers are actually working on this"
"08-31","21:08","network layer the routers work"
"08-31","21:15","especially on the network layer of course it will also it also has the lower layer like uh link layer and the"
"08-31","21:22","physical layer okay I will see up to network layer okay routers work up to"
"08-31","21:27","networking and then what will happen is in"
"08-31","21:32","networking is if we have a big message okay this message is an application"
"08-31","21:40","layer recorded message and at each later it has a different name okay so usually what we do is we need to break this"
"08-31","21:47","application layer message into smaller pieces"
"08-31","21:55","add different layers okay and then these pieces will finally"
"08-31","22:00","be passed to the network layers then for at the network layer we call"
"08-31","22:05","these pieces as uh the packets okay sometimes we say packages used a lot in"
"08-31","22:12","network but package it's like a general term but a package"
"08-31","22:18","actually if we be very formal package should be used in the network layer okay"
"08-31","22:25","it means the network layer thing and then basically what the router will do is"
"08-31","22:31","the router will carry this packet okay"
"08-31","22:37","carry this packet and pass it so for example if this is the sauce this is the destination then the router will"
"08-31","22:45","carry this package and forward it to the correct router"
"08-31","22:54","okay and you can see we may have different parts here here is called the routing actually okay and later again we are"
"08-31","23:01","going to talk more about this but now you can see this is uh the major functionality of the router okay the two"
"08-31","23:09","functions are one of the function is actually called the routine okay the other section is called forwarding"
"08-31","23:17","forwarding forwarding basically means for example when this package when this router receives a packet and then this"
"08-31","23:25","router needs to decide should I forward it to this router if we have a b"
"08-31","23:33","C and D okay this router a it receives a packet"
"08-31","23:38","it will need to decide should I forward this package to b or to C"
"08-31","23:43","okay so this is called forwarding and routine is more like more big picture"
"08-31","23:49","right routine is like choosing a path like this okay"
"08-31","24:00","but for wording as you can see forwarding is actually like it's local and locally I need to decide which"
"08-31","24:07","interface I should forward to okay question is mentioning using diagram"
"08-31","24:13","great yeah that's great point when we do the routine we need to use it we usually"
"08-31","24:19","need to choose the shortest path right or the least cost part so di construct"
"08-31","24:26","algorithm is actually one very important uh component in the routing although"
"08-31","24:31","this is not the only um algorithm used in your routine but it's a very important one okay and a"
"08-31","24:39","very commonly useful one in routine and we are going to talk more about that in the network layer"
"08-31","24:44","thanks for pointing out thanks for pointing out the question"
"08-31","24:51","any other questions or comments okay then now let's talk about how a"
"08-31","25:00","router worked okay and here again you can see we have a source computer a destination computer"
"08-31","25:07","and you can see the link has a bandwidth of our again rbps VPS I"
"08-31","25:14","mean beats per second okay this one also has rbps okay they may I"
"08-31","25:21","mean the link capacity may be the same or maybe different it doesn't really"
"08-31","25:27","matter okay so here we can have R1 R2 maybe okay but Force us"
"08-31","25:33","um Simplicity here we just assume those two links should have the same bandwidth"
"08-31","25:40","which are okay and now we have three packets"
"08-31","25:45","one two three each packet has L Beats"
"08-31","25:51","okay each pack has all these and they pay attention the router when"
"08-31","25:57","it works if you use a mechanism called store and forward what does this mean"
"08-31","26:03","this means when the routes are forward the package"
"08-31","26:08","it needs to wait for the whole package to arrive okay"
"08-31","26:15","yes this packet is not complete then the router will not send this out"
"08-31","26:20","it will not send an incomplete packet out okay so it will wait until the"
"08-31","26:27","entire package comes in the package is stored in the launcher and then the"
"08-31","26:32","router forward it out so this is called store and forward"
"08-31","26:38","okay and now you can see if you recall what we have just learned"
"08-31","26:48","here do you still remember here when we talk about pushing the data into the link right so it happens at the computer"
"08-31","26:55","side basically this computer needs to spend L"
"08-31","27:02","over R time to push the data into the link this is called the transmission"
"08-31","27:09","delay this is the delay happened at the route at the computer side okay at the"
"08-31","27:15","computer side and now if you look at this scenario"
"08-31","27:24","in this scenario the data first will be put will be pushed from the computer"
"08-31","27:30","let's see if this is a and a b okay it will be pushed from a into the link"
"08-31","27:38","and can you tell me the transmission delay we spent here"
"08-31","27:44","can you tell me how much time do we need to push"
"08-31","27:49","do we need to push one packet into the link"
"08-31","27:54","based on what we have learned before can you tell me the time let's see this is Arrow one this is L2"
"08-31","28:02","from a to L1 we see the time we spend is Lor actually right it's l over"
"08-31","28:10","this panahira is our or okay and then when the packet won when the"
"08-31","28:18","packaging one arrives at the router thus the router need to push it out"
"08-31","28:25","again yes the router need to push it out again"
"08-31","28:31","to link L2 why because here we haven't received we haven't"
"08-31","28:39","arrived at the destination yet right so of course the router need to push it out again can you tell me how much time do we need"
"08-31","28:47","to spend here at the router to push the data out"
"08-31","28:54","or formally we can see how much time what is the transmission delay as the"
"08-31","29:01","router that should be L over right that should be l over r"
"08-31","29:09","again okay of course if these are a different then here for l y if this is"
"08-31","29:15","R1 okay for L2 if this is R2 then I would say l-o-r-2 it depends on"
"08-31","29:22","the link right so then if R1 equal to R2 then in total"
"08-31","29:30","finally I mean the next step is the packet arrived at the destination right so when the packet arrives at the"
"08-31","29:37","destination do we need to push it out again no need right because it already arrived"
"08-31","29:43","at the next destination why do we need to push it again so then in total if you think about this"
"08-31","29:49","entire process how much time do we spend to push the"
"08-31","29:54","data to the link what is the total transmission delay if"
"08-31","29:59","you think about this"
"08-31","30:12","the total transmission delay is actually the time we spend at R1"
"08-31","30:20","sorry the ethnic one and the time we spent at the launcher link two"
"08-31","30:26","so it's lor1 Plus lor2 if if R1 equal to"
"08-31","30:31","R2 then we have 2 L over r okay so in this example if L equal to"
"08-31","30:37","7.5 magnitude Max this and r equal to 1.5 microbps then the one-hub"
"08-31","30:44","transmission is actually 7.5 over 1.5 which is a this is 7.5 over 1.5 which is 5 right"
"08-31","30:54","then at basically that means at at the computer a we need to spend five seconds"
"08-31","30:59","at the router side we need to simplify five seconds so in total the transmission delay is actually 10"
"08-31","31:06","seconds okay and we are going to discuss more about the delay in the future but this is a"
"08-31","31:15","definitely the beginning okay I really hope you pay attention to this and this"
"08-31","31:20","will be on the test"
"09-01","0:03","transmission delay which is actually the time you spent to push the data to push"
"09-01","0:10","the data out to the link it's like you have water here in the water tank and"
"09-01","0:16","then the water takes time to flow into the link to completely follow into the"
"09-01","0:22","link okay into the water pipe so it's the same thing so for 1.3 we will introduce Network"
"09-01","0:30","core can you still record what is in our core"
"09-01","0:37","are the data centers in our core are the servers in the network core"
"09-01","0:43","so the network record is just just to the routers okay so"
"09-01","0:49","um it's basically a match of internet interconnecting routers like this okay"
"09-01","0:55","and um so basically what the function of the"
"09-01","1:02","network call is to forward the package from one router to another and then to"
"09-01","1:07","another and then to another and finally it will arrive at the destination okay"
"09-01","1:13","so that is the function for Network call um each packet is transmitted at the"
"09-01","1:18","four link capacity um so"
"09-01","1:24","then some of you may ask how can we get the packets so we generally"
"09-01","1:30","um later you will learn uh when we send something out this something is called"
"09-01","1:36","message after the application layer okay for example email message HTTP request"
"09-01","1:41","message okay it's called a message and then when it goes to a layer below like"
"09-01","1:48","the transport layer we will we have to break this message into smaller pieces which are called"
"09-01","1:56","packets okay of course are different later they have different names sometimes they'll cause the datagram"
"09-01","2:02","sometimes they are called packets okay sometimes they are called frames uh and"
"09-01","2:07","for now we will just call them packets but later uh we you will learn the names"
"09-01","2:14","at each layer okay so here again we want to talk about the"
"09-01","2:20","Lor thing okay so pack a switch"
"09-01","2:25","um package which include the ruptures and the um switches so here we are we talk about"
"09-01","2:33","routers for now okay the functionality for pack switch is the"
"09-01","2:39","package switching we call it package switching okay and it use it use some"
"09-01","2:44","method or mechanism called store and forward so what is Stone forward"
"09-01","2:49","let's look at this example here in this example we have three packets okay uh"
"09-01","2:55","one two three and you can see uh we will send the package we will send the data"
"09-01","3:01","to the link okay and then they have arrived at the router"
"09-01","3:08","so Stone forward means the entire package must arrive at the"
"09-01","3:16","router before it can be transmitted onto next link"
"09-01","3:22","okay so for example if you look at the packet of one half of the packet has already been sent"
"09-01","3:29","had already been delivered to the router okay and the other half is still here at the computer"
"09-01","3:35","now in this case the router cannot send this half onto the link because this"
"09-01","3:43","packet is not complete yet okay it will wait until the entire packet is clicked"
"09-01","3:50","is is complete and then send the data to this link"
"09-01","3:55","okay so this is called store and forward why do we need to discuss Stone forward"
"09-01","4:02","because we need to understand the transmission delay again okay do you"
"09-01","4:09","still remember transmission delay I told you here right I said is the time we use"
"09-01","4:17","to push the data to the link okay push the data out to"
"09-01","4:23","the name and you can think about this in this example in this example okay"
"09-01","4:30","so of course at the computer side firstly we need to put this push the"
"09-01","4:35","data out okay let's assume again that the package"
"09-01","4:40","is lbs okay now how much time and also the"
"09-01","4:46","bandwidth of the transmission rate for the first link is our okay"
"09-01","4:52","R BTS RBS per second then let me ask you the question how much time is needed"
"09-01","5:02","to push the data to push one package out to to the link"
"09-01","5:10","can tell me anybody want to a gas or I will try"
"09-01","5:20","how much time is needed to push one package"
"09-01","5:25","to the knee Kyle and uh hey Kyle said uh uh L over r"
"09-01","5:35","that is correct excellent so yes the time we need it here we can go to dt1"
"09-01","5:43","transmission delay 1 equals 2 L over r okay"
"09-01","5:49","and then those data will flow flow flow and then come to the launcher"
"09-01","5:57","so again the router will and wait until the entire packet is complete and then"
"09-01","6:04","push data out again okay so let me ask you a question do we"
"09-01","6:10","have transmission delay at the router"
"09-01","6:15","the way how transmission delay at the router that means do we need to spend some time"
"09-01","6:22","pushing the data out again from the router"
"09-01","6:28","yes because the data now the package is arrived at the router right we also need"
"09-01","6:33","to push it out so yes it still takes time to push out again it's like the"
"09-01","6:39","water flows from one tank to another tank okay it needs to flow off again so then"
"09-01","6:46","the time spent here can you tell me the time spent here equal to what"
"09-01","6:51","dt2 equal to what so that is L over R again why because"
"09-01","6:58","the package size is still l okay and the link the second link also"
"09-01","7:05","has a bandwidth of R so that's why it's l over R again okay"
"09-01","7:11","and then finally the data now arrived at the computer okay at the destination"
"09-01","7:17","if you consider the entire process if we do not consider any other delays"
"09-01","7:23","whatever okay we only consider the transmission delay we only consider the time we spent on pushing the data out"
"09-01","7:30","how much time in total did we spend on pushing the data out to"
"09-01","7:37","the link so it's just a dt1 plus dt2 right okay"
"09-01","7:43","that's great if you look at the example on the right one hop numerical example"
"09-01","7:49","in example L equals 7 0.5 Mbps MBS and R equals to 1.5 Mbps"
"09-01","7:58","so then Lor equal to 5. that means for"
"09-01","8:04","one Hub transmission delay that is uh five seconds okay so what what does one"
"09-01","8:10","hop mean one hop means here you can say uh from from here to here is one half from"
"09-01","8:18","here to here is another half okay um then in this example in total we say"
"09-01","8:25","okay the DT equals to d t one plus dt2"
"09-01","8:31","can you tell me the total number foreign"
"09-01","8:36","that equals 2 actually 10 seconds"
"09-01","8:43","okay so that equal to second in this example that is the transmission delay"
"09-01","8:48","we spent okay so the reason we have dt2 is because"
"09-01","8:55","of these store and forward mechanism okay any questions"
"09-01","9:06","all right so actually there are many other types of delays okay in this one"
"09-01","9:13","we only talk about uh some some of them and later when we talk about the"
"09-01","9:18","performance of the network I will introduce more okay for now let's consider another type of delay that is"
"09-01","9:26","queuing delay so what is you think about this when the pack is"
"09-01","9:32","arrive at the barometer the router needs some time to work on those packets for"
"09-01","9:37","example it may check the headers let me check the IP address it may"
"09-01","9:44","do some error checking Etc okay it takes time for the router to deal with this"
"09-01","9:50","package that means the router may be slow but the incoming"
"09-01","9:57","rate can be fast okay that means that there"
"09-01","10:02","there are more and more packets coming in so those packets cannot be dealt with"
"09-01","10:09","quickly now in this case they will be queued in the router and waiting to be"
"09-01","10:15","sent out okay so that is the queuing delay it's like it's just like uh when you go"
"09-01","10:22","to my office hours okay for example I need to spend time"
"09-01","10:28","um students okay on each student and then you that if there are so many students"
"09-01","10:35","coming in then this you don't have to be queue there okay that is the queuing delay"
"09-01","10:41","um currently usually indicates the network in the launcher at least the router is very busy"
"09-01","10:48","okay indicates the launcher is busy that's further indicates the network is"
"09-01","10:53","probably congested okay it's probably congested um but this is uh this is a"
"09-01","11:02","not the worst scenario okay even worse is sometimes the round should get too busy"
"09-01","11:09","okay uh and the router as you can see the launcher needs in some place to"
"09-01","11:16","store those um those packets so that is called the buffer"
"09-01","11:22","okay each router has a buffer to store those cute packets and sometimes the buffer is a full if"
"09-01","11:29","the buffer is a 4 and if there are still incoming packets what will happen"
"09-01","11:37","the the router will say oh I cannot hold more packets I cannot accomplish more so"
"09-01","11:43","I have to drop you okay then in this case we will have"
"09-01","11:49","data loss okay packet loss the package can be dropped if the memory"
"09-01","11:55","or buffer fills up okay it's just like when you go to my office hours I say oh"
"09-01","12:01","I can my my office can only outcome the 10 students okay if you are the 11th one"
"09-01","12:06","if you come in then I'll just kick you out okay so that is why the loss happens"
"09-01","12:12","in the test I may ask you"
"09-01","12:17","uh what are the reasons for queuing delay and what are the reasons for loss"
"09-01","12:24","okay uh you can see the reason for Q delay is because the incoming rate is much faster"
"09-01","12:31","than uploading rate Okay the reason that the loss can happen is because the memory or the buffer of"
"09-01","12:38","the voucher is for okay so then let's continue to discuss the two Network core functionalities"
"09-01","12:46","so the network code usually have two functions one is routing another one forwarding routine means determine the"
"09-01","12:54","source to destination routes taken by the packets okay um"
"09-01","13:00","the forwarding means move the packets from the wrong stress input to appropriate output okay so you may say"
"09-01","13:09","what are the differences what are the difference between routing and forwarding it is very different"
"09-01","13:17","um let's use the analogy of travel again okay so if you travel from New York to"
"09-01","13:26","Chicago sorry yeah sorry and if you travel from let's say Sacramento"
"09-01","13:34","okay to New York"
"09-01","13:40","okay and if this is Chicago"
"09-01","13:48","and if this is L A okay so you may decide to travel from Chicago"
"09-01","13:55","to New York or you want to travel from LA to New York okay so these are the"
"09-01","14:03","different rocks different ones when you choose the rubs that is the"
"09-01","14:10","routine okay for wording is like when you arrive at Chicago"
"09-01","14:17","okay she covered me how many incoming links and outgoing links to other cities okay"
"09-01","14:23","so when you arrived at Chicago Chicago need to decide oh okay so you need to go"
"09-01","14:29","to a biscuit okay in order to go to New York"
"09-01","14:34","so this is like forward forwarding you from the input ports to the output port"
"09-01","14:41","took to the appropriate output port and you may ask how could we do the"
"09-01","14:47","forwarding okay so routine is like determining the route okay foreign is like uh forward"
"09-01","14:56","the the packet from the incoming Port input port"
"09-01","15:02","to the appropriate output cost does this make sense it's like when you"
"09-01","15:08","arrive at Chicago Chicago will need to determine oh there are so many gates okay these are all the gates"
"09-01","15:16","foreign for you to to board again to fly again"
"09-01","15:24","how can we determine the route right who will determine the route the routing algorithm will determine the route and"
"09-01","15:31","who how can we determine the forwarding how can we do the forwarding okay I haven't talked about that part yet so"
"09-01","15:38","when we do the forwarding here for this example analogy you know okay I want to forward this person to this gate okay"
"09-01","15:47","how do we determine that uh in in networking it's similar things in networking we have something called the"
"09-01","15:53","local forwarding table local foreign people will check the header value of"
"09-01","15:58","each packet okay so the header value usually contains for example the IP address later we are going to talk more"
"09-01","16:03","about that but for now you only need to know oh okay each packet may have a header value"
"09-01","16:09","and then the router will check the header value to decide the output link"
"09-01","16:15","for example this one is zero one one so zero one one means oh I need to forward"
"09-01","16:20","this package to up output link two that means this one"
"09-01","16:25","okay so that is how the forwarding is done and some of you may ask uh then how"
"09-01","16:31","can we determine this Local 4 on the table that is a great question so determining"
"09-01","16:38","local foreign table we have to use routing Amazon the"
"09-01","16:43","routing algorithm the router will basically run the wrong key algorithm to determine the local forwarding table and"
"09-01","16:51","then the router will follow this local community board to do the forwarding okay answer for how we will discuss this"
"09-01","17:00","later in the network layer okay in the one two three four probably the fourth"
"09-01","17:05","capture okay we will determine uh the how we can run rough calcium and then"
"09-01","17:11","determine the local following table okay next the last discuss another type of"
"09-01","17:17","core okay we just talk about the packet switching after there is another type of"
"09-01","17:24","Network code which is called circuit switching okay"
"09-01","17:30","so what is circuit switching um circuit switching is very special"
"09-01","17:35","okay for now let's say you have destination you have computer a and computer B they want to communicate okay"
"09-01","17:44","surface which is like reserved around for them"
"09-01","17:49","okay Reserve are right for them for example you can see now each link we have four links now okay this link"
"09-01","17:56","this is called a link and each link has a full circuit as you can see circuit"
"09-01","18:01","one two three and four"
"09-01","18:06","okay so each link has a four third circuits"
"09-01","18:11","if a wants to talk to B what we can do is we reserve"
"09-01","18:19","this link sorry this circuit and"
"09-01","18:24","this circuit so we reserve these two circuits for the"
"09-01","18:30","communication between A and B nobody else can use it only A and B can use"
"09-01","18:35","this to communicate so it's like telephone Network okay it's uh that means it's dedicated"
"09-01","18:43","resource okay and there's no sharing it has a certain like performance the"
"09-01","18:49","performance is guaranteed because nobody else is competing with you okay"
"09-01","18:54","you can use this this uh this link uh this circuit"
"09-01","18:59","um uh if you want okay and pay attention"
"09-01","19:05","because no sharing happens okay so this surface segment May idle may get idle if"
"09-01","19:13","no one is using it if a is not using this circuit okay nobody else can use it"
"09-01","19:20","so then the circuit is is it becomes idle okay so this is commonly used in traditional"
"09-01","19:27","telephony networks uh it is not used very often now okay it's not usable now"
"09-01","19:34","it's all like also time design any questions"
"09-01","19:43","okay so pay attention again circuits which is like reserved okay reserved"
"09-01","19:50","resources dedicated resources okay uh but when we see reserved or dedicated"
"09-01","19:56","that doesn't mean uh A and B will will take this circuit forever"
"09-01","20:03","okay no no it's not like that okay it's just the mains it's just the means"
"09-01","20:10","um uh this uh this this this uh this"
"09-01","20:16","circuit may be reserved for example for a certain time so between this for"
"09-01","20:22","example this is a second nobody else can use it okay between this second this is"
"09-01","20:27","a reserved for end okay or it can be um reserved in some other way for"
"09-01","20:33","example uh as as here we will see it can be frequency different okay so let's"
"09-01","20:38","talk about two ways for reserving Huawei is called free consideration"
"09-01","20:49","okay let's see if we have four users and then we we have only one channel how"
"09-01","20:56","can we allow for users to communicate at the same time if they all want to use this channel"
"09-01","21:03","what we can do is we divide the this entire channel into different frequencies okay then each user will use"
"09-01","21:11","its own uh frequency okay that's mommy another way is we do"
"09-01","21:20","time limit so time DNA basically means oh I can divide the time and"
"09-01","21:28","um so at the for example if each each uh bar here is just one second so then the"
"09-01","21:36","blue user can use this many seconds okay first seconds uh fifth second it's like that okay the"
"09-01","21:43","green users can do this okay it is reserved in that second for"
"09-01","21:50","the blue users of reusers okay nobody else can use that does this make sense"
"09-01","21:57","this is time table time with emitter might flexing and"
"09-01","22:04","frequency dividend might collection okay um let me give you an analogy"
"09-01","22:11","when you drive on the road so you may have one rope and we have so"
"09-01","22:18","many different types of cars driving on the road right foreign is like oh I have this many cars"
"09-01","22:28","there's many different uh types then I can divide this road into different"
"09-01","22:34","lengths different lens"
"09-01","22:40","okay for example I may have buses"
"09-01","22:46","on this line and small cars on this line and trucks"
"09-01","22:52","I'm listening okay they can only drive on their own land they cannot use others"
"09-01","22:59","lens okay that is the frequency given time remainder is like"
"09-01","23:05","okay I have only one Road okay so the first hour"
"09-01","23:16","for the first hour only buses can drive okay buses can be here for the entire"
"09-01","23:23","life can can use any any um we have no lens now okay"
"09-01","23:31","so the bus can drive in whatever way it is like it likes okay so the second"
"09-01","23:38","hour we will have smaller cuts to drive on the road nobody else can use this room"
"09-01","23:45","and the third hour only trucks"
"09-01","23:52","only trucks can drive on the road nobody else can use that so it's like that and"
"09-01","23:58","of course the fourth algorithm will help us again fifth we'll have cards again okay any questions"
"09-01","24:10","okay Okay so then for circuit switching and packaging"
"09-01","24:16","we know they are different package switching we do not do any reservation which is not dedicated resources if you"
"09-01","24:23","want to send something you can go ahead to send it but we cannot guarantee the resources are available for you"
"09-01","24:31","okay for circuit switching we will guarantee you have resources okay which"
"09-01","24:37","way is better okay which way is better the conclusion is"
"09-01","24:43","packing switching allows more users to use the network"
"09-01","24:48","okay um how do we know that we can do some"
"09-01","24:53","calculation okay now we assume we have a link that is one Mbps one m means one"
"09-01","25:02","mega bits per second okay so this is the benefit of the link"
"09-01","25:08","that's basically equals to 1000 kb per"
"09-01","25:15","second right one Mega beats equal to one thousand KB"
"09-01","25:21","then um we assume"
"09-01","25:26","if the user is active active means it wants to communicate it"
"09-01","25:31","wants to transmit data then this user"
"09-01","25:37","will use 100 kb per second okay"
"09-01","25:43","and also for every user the average time for it to be active is"
"09-01","25:50","just 10 percent of the time okay it's not always working right it's it will"
"09-01","25:56","works only for 10 of the time okay"
"09-01","26:01","um then in this case let's do some calculation if we are using circuit switching how"
"09-01","26:09","many users can be accommodate you think about this for circuit switching we need to reserve the"
"09-01","26:18","resource for the users so how many how many users can be accommodate"
"09-01","26:27","so basically we have in total 1000 kb per second this is the Total"
"09-01","26:34","Resource we have right and each one each user want to use"
"09-01","26:40","100 PB per second"
"09-01","26:46","that means we can accommodate at most 10 users"
"09-01","26:52","right so it's like you have 1 000 airports each person"
"09-01","26:58","wants to get 100 airports so how many people can you can you can give airport"
"09-01","27:03","you can give only 10 people okay so it's like that"
"09-01","27:09","very simple very straightforward but how about pack is switching"
"09-01","27:15","for package switching how many users cannot complete"
"09-01","27:21","okay so here we give an example if we have 35 users"
"09-01","27:28","if we have 35 users keep in mind again those 35 users are"
"09-01","27:35","not always working each user will only be active for 10 percent of time"
"09-01","27:42","okay and again if they are all working of"
"09-01","27:47","course we cannot we cannot accommodate that many users right as long as there are less there are 10"
"09-01","27:54","or less users being active then we are good okay because we can accommodate and most"
"09-01","28:01","10 users at the same time then you may want to calculate"
"09-01","28:06","what is the probability for more than 10 users being active at the same time"
"09-01","28:14","because if this probability is very big very high"
"09-01","28:19","that means it's not good because there are always more than 10"
"09-01","28:24","million for example there are always modern users being active then"
"09-01","28:29","then um there are some users who cannot use the resources right but if the"
"09-01","28:35","probability is a very low that's a good thing okay"
"09-01","28:41","actually if you do the calculation the probability for 10 users being active at"
"09-01","28:48","the same time is less than 0.0004 it's a very small probability"
"09-01","28:56","okay that means it's a good thing okay that means we can actually accompany"
"09-01","29:03","a lot of users because not many will be active at the same time"
"09-01","29:09","okay so some of you may ask how do you how did we get this value this value is calculated using the"
"09-01","29:18","probability Theory so basically for example if we have 11 users being active"
"09-01","29:24","at the same time the probability is a month 35"
"09-01","29:30","we randomly choose 11. okay and for the 11 users sorry"
"09-01","29:40","the 11 users we want them to be active at the same"
"09-01","29:46","time this is a 0.1 to the power 11. times"
"09-01","29:52","for all the others they have to be silent okay so that is 0.9"
"09-01","29:58","times all the others means the remaining 24 users"
"09-01","30:04","okay Plus if we have 12 users"
"09-01","30:11","being active at the same time so that is 35 we choose Tau randomly and then"
"09-01","30:19","0.1 to the power of 12 times 0.9 to the"
"09-01","30:25","power 23 because 23 also need to be silent plus C"
"09-01","30:31","35 which was 13 0.1 13 0.9"
"09-01","30:37","[Music] uh 22 plus continue until you are done"
"09-01","30:44","with all 35 users okay that's how we get the probability"
"09-01","30:50","so for this class you do not need to understand or remember this one no need"
"09-01","30:56","okay no need to remember the formula okay this is just to to uh show you how"
"09-01","31:03","we get the probability so the takeaway message"
"09-01","31:08","take away message is pack your switching can accommodate much"
"09-01","31:15","more users than circuit switching as you can imagine okay"
"09-01","31:20","but is package switching uh a slam dunk"
"09-01","31:26","winner okay we will say not naturally but most of the time packs which is better than"
"09-01","31:33","circuit switching okay package switching is great for birthday data"
"09-01","31:40","um so for example uh if you want to send a lot"
"09-01","31:46","of data the video data for example a lot of data I mean in a very short period"
"09-01","31:51","okay then package switching is is of course much better because you don't need to reserve things for others you"
"09-01","31:59","only need to utilize the resource as much as possible okay and it's very simple there is no"
"09-01","32:06","core setup for circuit switch if you want to share data you want to transmit"
"09-01","32:12","it and you have to set up a call first okay"
"09-01","32:18","um but the the the the down Point okay the"
"09-01","32:23","drawback of the package meeting is that you may experience the packet delay and loss because of the excessive congestion"
"09-01","32:31","you can imagine if a lot of users they all want to transmit data out then the network is too busy then in this case we"
"09-01","32:38","may experience the packet loss and delay okay um so in this case we may want to"
"09-01","32:44","address that issue what if packet is delayed what if a packet is lost so we"
"09-01","32:50","may need some protocols to address that issue um the protocols is called reliable data"
"09-01","32:56","transfer protocol okay and we may also need to do some congestion control to avoid a lot of users"
"09-01","33:04","overwhelming the network at the same time okay so that is congestion control"
"09-01","33:10","uh so then the question becomes oh how can we"
"09-01","33:15","accommodate more users while we can steal uh guarantee the performance okay"
"09-01","33:23","this is like the circle like Behavior how to provide circular Behavior which"
"09-01","33:29","means guarantee the performance while we can still accommodate more users"
"09-01","33:35","uh unfortunately this is steel and unsolved problem okay"
"09-01","33:42","uh the the researchers are still working really hard to address this problem"
"09-01","33:49","okay um so that's all about the package meeting and the circus meeting"
"09-07","0:03","all right so the next thing I'm going to discuss is about a network uh structure"
"09-07","0:08","or we say internet structure okay so we mentioned at the very first I mean the"
"09-07","0:16","second class we've discussed or the third class act so when we do the discussion I asked what is network and"
"09-07","0:22","most of USA Network is a combination of nodes and links okay so basically we"
"09-07","0:29","know okay we have a number of devices and we need to connect them together but the question is"
"09-07","0:36","the question is how can we connect those devices together throughout the study we have we have"
"09-07","0:43","done so far you learned that it is not possible to connect every device to the"
"09-07","0:51","other device directly with one cable you imagine this this is this the scalability is is a really bad okay so"
"09-07","1:00","that's why that's why instead of connecting those devices directly with"
"09-07","1:06","cables okay we usually we need something called Network code the routers in"
"09-07","1:12","between right routers in return to connect those devices so basically we"
"09-07","1:18","have access Networks okay access now works means the"
"09-07","1:23","institutional Network the residential Network the mobile networks okay so"
"09-07","1:29","those devices will access Internet through the access networks so those"
"09-07","1:34","devices will need to be connected to the access networks first and then the"
"09-07","1:39","access networks are connected to the routers to the internet core okay"
"09-07","1:47","and we can see we can also support those access networks sometimes we also call them access isps okay so uh I shouldn't"
"09-07","1:56","say this I should say the access is access internet service providers SP or"
"09-07","2:03","internet service providers like Comcast atnt they are all internet service providers so those access isps basically"
"09-07","2:12","provide those access networks for you to connect okay"
"09-07","2:18","so that's why we also have residential ISP company ISP University ISP okay so"
"09-07","2:26","then the question becomes oh we have those excess isps how can we connect"
"09-07","2:31","them together okay because if you do not connect them together they are still isolated"
"09-07","2:38","it's still it cannot be called as Internet okay so then we need to connect"
"09-07","2:44","them together how can we connect them together let's look at an example"
"09-07","2:49","so the question is given millions of access isps how to connect them together"
"09-07","2:56","we can imagine how many access isps we have right so your home network can"
"09-07","3:02","become Access Network your company Network University Network they are all"
"09-07","3:07","access networks okay how can we connect them together can we do this"
"09-07","3:14","can we connect each ISP to every other access ISD"
"09-07","3:19","select this what do you think"
"09-07","3:27","how to set a weekend but not a good idea what do you think what do others think"
"09-07","3:34","is this a good idea connect each one probably didn't see this clearly let's see connect each one"
"09-07","3:41","with every other this can this we can do this right it's"
"09-07","3:48","like we connect it's similar actually to the question we discussed before regarding devices we can of course"
"09-07","3:55","connect each device with with every other device but it's not scalable"
"09-07","4:01","okay okay so you all agree that this is not a good idea"
"09-07","4:07","it's the same thing here in this in this question okay if we connect each access"
"09-07","4:12","ISP to every other it says IP ISP this"
"09-07","4:18","does not scale why if you think about this if we have n"
"09-07","4:29","if we have any networks or an access networks okay so then"
"09-07","4:35","when we connected the first one with every other one we need to make n minus"
"09-07","4:40","one connections right then for the second one"
"09-07","4:48","for the second one we need to connect to every other"
"09-07","4:53","Excel Network we need to make another uh minus two connections because it is"
"09-07","4:59","the second one is already connected to the first one okay so that's why it's a minus two"
"09-07","5:05","then the third one and minus three the fourth one"
"09-07","5:11","and minus four so we'll continue until we only need to make one connection so"
"09-07","5:17","this is the number of connections we need to make if you have learned how to"
"09-07","5:22","calculate this okay this basically equal to one plus"
"09-07","5:29","a minus one this one plus this one"
"09-07","5:37","time the number the number the total number is n minus 1 divided by two"
"09-07","5:44","so this is basically n times n minus one divided by two so you can see"
"09-07","5:54","okay so this is okay so that's why you can see the"
"09-07","6:01","complexity is actually o big N2"
"09-07","6:06","okay all big and square then this doesn't scale that's why this is not a good idea that's why we want to use"
"09-07","6:15","something in the middle to connect every Access Network okay so"
"09-07","6:20","now what is in the middle if what we put in the middle is called the ISP Global IST which can provide a"
"09-07","6:29","number of routers okay but can we have one Global ISP"
"09-07","6:36","apparently no why because"
"09-07","6:43","we may have competitors okay"
"09-07","6:48","you may have competitors"
"09-07","6:54","Jim said okay no problem James please go ahead to"
"09-07","7:01","reconnect and rejoin if you need okay sorry for interrupting"
"09-07","7:07","um so as we said we cannot have one Global SP we may have competitors then"
"09-07","7:13","the competitors here means we have a number of isps and we may have iSpa ispb"
"09-07","7:19","ispc okay or even more so it's like we have Comcast ATT so this is"
"09-07","7:29","this is within one country of course between the countries we may also have other competitors right so it's like in"
"09-07","7:36","China we also have other uh SP providers okay so then"
"09-07","7:43","now we have ice piece so you can see all the access networks are connected to ISP"
"09-07","7:48","to the isps but we still need to connect those isps together if they are not"
"09-07","7:54","connected together then again this internet is is not an internet right it's not connected"
"09-07","8:00","so then we will connect them using some peering links okay and on top of this okay we may have"
"09-07","8:08","some internet exchange points okay it's still used to connect those"
"09-07","8:14","um those isps okay the functionality is basically the same as the peer links okay"
"09-07","8:23","and then we may also have some Regional networks the regional networks can"
"09-07","8:29","connect those access networks and then be connected to the global isps or"
"09-07","8:34","connect to the to the isps okay on top of that we may also have some other"
"09-07","8:41","content provider Network so what are those uh basically some big companies"
"09-07","8:46","like Google you think about this like Google Microsoft especially for those"
"09-07","8:52","um video providers like YouTube right so they do not want to use"
"09-07","8:59","the services from the internet service providers why because they need to pay a"
"09-07","9:05","lot of money so some of those big companies they may run their own network"
"09-07","9:11","they may want to bring the services closer to the users okay so the users"
"09-07","9:18","can get faster speed you can access their resources faster like downloading videos faster like that so those those"
"09-07","9:26","Networks established by those big companies are called the content provider Network okay"
"09-07","9:33","later when we talk about the video applications we are going to discuss more about this"
"09-07","9:38","but now you can see you can see the structure okay the structure of Internet is basically a network of networks we"
"09-07","9:47","have a bunch of excess ice piece and then on top of that"
"09-07","9:52","we have Regional isps which may connect to the access isps and then we have some"
"09-07","9:58","Tier 1 isps and also the content provider networks so those all these things are connected"
"09-07","10:06","with each other okay they are interconnected so that's like the structure of the internet okay"
"09-07","10:13","any questions so far I XP"
"09-07","10:27","okay XP is internet exchange point so as we have"
"09-07","10:33","learned here do you see okay so basically sometimes we use uh"
"09-07","10:41","those those links called periodics to connect the ISP together but sometimes we use"
"09-07","10:46","internet exchange points to connect those ISP together"
"09-07","10:52","okay any other questions"
"09-07","11:00","okay all right so then you can see uh this is a like the theorem or one example for"
"09-07","11:08","tier one ISP this is the network for Sprint and uh you may say the those red points"
"09-07","11:16","are called point of presence so those point of presents are very important so"
"09-07","11:22","they have routers to connect to the backbone Network and they also have the"
"09-07","11:27","routers connected to the customers and then they need those routers be connected to each other okay so to make"
"09-07","11:35","this entire network work all right so that's all about the network core any questions so far"
"09-07","11:48","okay so the next thing we are going to discuss is about uh the performance of"
"09-07","11:54","the networks including the delays the loss the throughput Etc"
"09-07","11:59","we have learned about some of the delays like transmission delay before but today"
"09-07","12:05","we are going to cover more delays and we may have some calculations we may have some"
"09-07","12:12","questions that may appear in the test so please pay attention to this section the first question is"
"09-07","12:18","how do the delay and loss occur so I have just actually I explained in"
"09-07","12:25","the review just now right when the package arrives okay when the packet arrival rate"
"09-07","12:35","exceeds the output link capacity that means the incoming speed is faster"
"09-07","12:42","than the outgoing speed then in this case we may have"
"09-07","12:48","we may have the package queued here in the router so if the incoming speed"
"09-07","12:56","is much faster than outgoing speed then we may have the"
"09-07","13:01","package queued in the router this is called queuing delay okay"
"09-07","13:07","then those are those packets have to be queued there waiting to be processed by"
"09-07","13:12","the router if this if I mean the the speed are even"
"09-07","13:19","faster the incoming speeds are even faster and finally the router run out of buffer"
"09-07","13:28","then the router will say I do not have enough space to hold you okay so I have to drop"
"09-07","13:35","here that is called the package drop okay this is how the loss happens okay it's"
"09-07","13:44","like if in my office hours Let's see if I can handle if if let's say in the physical office"
"09-07","13:53","hours my office can handle at most common animals that 10 students in my"
"09-07","14:00","office then if we have the 11th one tells one coming I will say oh sorry I"
"09-07","14:06","cannot accommodate more students right now okay so please please leave then that's like package drop okay"
"09-07","14:14","so as I said this may become a test question I may"
"09-07","14:20","ask you how could the queen delay happen you"
"09-07","14:25","know that's because the incoming speed is bigger than outgoing speed okay if I"
"09-07","14:33","ask how could the loss happen then that's because the buffer of the routers"
"09-07","14:42","are for okay"
"09-07","14:48","okay um there is a question in the chat how is that corrected when a package is"
"09-07","14:53","dropped this is a great question if a packet is dropped what will happen"
"09-07","14:58","next what should we do okay this is actually one major topic we are going to"
"09-07","15:04","discuss in the transportator about reliable data transfer okay there are"
"09-07","15:10","actually a very complicated mechanism to correct that okay so for example we may"
"09-07","15:16","notify the sender say hey the packet is lost I didn't receive that please resend"
"09-07","15:22","it okay so the sender May resend it so that is one mechanism that may be used to correct this okay I don't want to"
"09-07","15:30","dive deep into this topic because we are going to keep devote a lot of time to that topic but hopefully hopefully that"
"09-07","15:37","gives you a basic idea to that problem great question question uh any other"
"09-07","15:43","questions"
"09-07","15:48","okay great so then let's look at the the"
"09-07","15:55","packaging delay packet delay is actually a very"
"09-07","16:00","important part in networking you think about uh if I'm not sure if you have"
"09-07","16:05","used any of the functionality functionalities before for example when you're playing a network"
"09-07","16:11","sometimes it will show how much time it takes for"
"09-07","16:17","uh for a packet to um to arrive at the destination and then"
"09-07","16:22","come back right or sometimes we say oh the network is very fast the network is very slow and what does this mean"
"09-07","16:28","Network fast basically means um your packets or your data can arrive"
"09-07","16:34","at the destination very fast okay then"
"09-07","16:40","um network is very slow means your packet can arrive at the network very slowly"
"09-07","16:46","okay then pack a delay is actually one major component in this"
"09-07","16:53","in this um in this process okay"
"09-07","16:59","so then what are the what are the reasons for packet delay why do we have"
"09-07","17:04","a pack really we have learned one reason one reason is called transmission delay"
"09-07","17:11","okay why do we have transmission delay if your skill remember what we learned"
"09-07","17:16","transmission delay basically happens because"
"09-07","17:22","we may have a link okay the link is like water pipe then the data is like water"
"09-07","17:28","you have to push the data into the link so that is the transmission delay okay"
"09-07","17:35","and in addition to that we may also have a third other type of delays one type is"
"09-07","17:43","called noodle processingly so what is nodal processingly no the processing link is usually used"
"09-07","17:50","by the routers to check the bit errors to determine"
"09-07","17:55","which output link I should forward this package to okay usually the noodle"
"09-07","18:01","processing delay is very fast it's typically smaller than 10 seconds okay"
"09-07","18:07","then that's another processionally it happens within the router okay that's the second type"
"09-07","18:14","we talk about one type transmission delay another type is noodle processing delay the third type of delay is secure"
"09-07","18:22","delay currently I have also mentioned right so q a happens because you need to"
"09-07","18:27","wait at the launcher okay for transmission"
"09-07","18:32","okay because there are so many packets written there it's like in my office hours again okay this depends on the"
"09-07","18:40","congestion level of the router the community Lane may be very long maybe very short okay so it varies"
"09-07","18:49","M second season is a milliseconds"
"09-07","18:54","okay yeah and then"
"09-07","19:01","um that's the third type of delay the last type of delay is called propagation delay what is professionally propagation"
"09-07","19:09","delay is the time we spent from one stop for for example after the package enters"
"09-07","19:16","the this and enters the link from one stop and here it arrives at another stop that"
"09-07","19:24","is the propagation delay okay so some of you may ask what is the"
"09-07","19:30","difference between transmission delay and propagation delay let's think about this"
"09-07","19:37","if um you are moving from Sacramento to New York okay"
"09-07","19:43","then the first thing you need to do is you need to pack all your stuff onto a trunk okay you need to push all your all"
"09-07","19:50","your things onto the truck that's like the transmission deal you are moving things onto a truck and then after that you have to drive"
"09-07","19:57","your truck from Sacramento to New York it may take maybe months"
"09-07","20:04","okay maybe days maybe months so that time is called the propagation DeLay So"
"09-07","20:09","you see the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay transmission delay is like when you pack your stuff onto the truck okay and there"
"09-07","20:17","is also another um now let's see here there is a Formula"
"09-07","20:22","here the formula here you can see the transmission the other propagation delay and this is how to calculate the"
"09-07","20:29","transmission delay transmission element have learned it's actually related to the packet length and the link bandwidth"
"09-07","20:37","okay so if we want to send 100 bits out and if we know the"
"09-07","20:45","link pandemic is uh 20 let's see 20 bits per second then the transmission delay"
"09-07","20:51","will be 100 over 20 that's fine okay so that's the transmission delay"
"09-07","20:56","the propagation delay is actually related to two things one thing is the"
"09-07","21:02","length of the physical link how long how long is this link the second is the"
"09-07","21:08","propagation speed of the single law okay the signal propagation speed in the"
"09-07","21:14","medium so then the propagation delay is very simple it's D over s"
"09-07","21:19","okay the distance over speed I think I believe you have learned this before right"
"09-07","21:26","I mean physics in Facebook you have probably learned this"
"09-07","21:32","so they are very different there is an example here a better example to explain the difference between transmission"
"09-07","21:38","delay and propagation delay for example now if we View"
"09-07","21:44","this Caravan this tank Caravan as one packet"
"09-07","21:54","okay this is one packet this card ticket has 10 bits okay we have 10 cards each"
"09-07","22:00","card is one bit then when they pass through when they pass through this table"
"09-07","22:06","then it's like we are pushing data into the link okay so we may take we may take for"
"09-07","22:14","example uh 12 seconds to push every uh to push every car okay"
"09-07","22:21","12 seconds to push every car then in total we have 10 cards then we have 120"
"09-07","22:29","seconds okay so this is like the transmission delay this is how this is"
"09-07","22:34","when you push the cars or this Caravan this team ain't throw the booth okay but"
"09-07","22:42","after that we have after that between these two both to the next toe box we"
"09-07","22:49","have such a long distance that's 100 kilometers okay then this card this car Caroline"
"09-07","22:55","has to draw uh maybe drive for two hours or three"
"09-07","23:01","hours to arrive at the second tour bus okay so that is the propagation delay"
"09-07","23:07","you see the difference okay so the time spent here"
"09-07","23:14","is a transmission delay"
"09-07","23:21","to push every character the time spent on the road"
"09-07","23:34","is called propagation delay okay"
"09-07","23:40","so now I want you to do a um maybe let's let me finish this let me"
"09-07","23:47","finish this and I'll do a give you a question you you can work on okay"
"09-07","23:52","so uh let's talk about the community a little bit okay the cunile is related to"
"09-07","23:59","third things one thing is linked bandwidth second thing is the Packy length and third thing is the average"
"09-07","24:06","package arrival rate okay you can say that this this traffic is"
"09-07","24:13","defined by the traffic intensity okay which is equal which equals to L A over"
"09-07","24:20","r okay and as you can see if we have more package arrival"
"09-07","24:26","okay if we have if this is a very large if a is very large Okay then if this"
"09-07","24:32","becomes bigger and bigger then the traffic intensity becomes higher and higher when it arrives at around one"
"09-07","24:39","when it approaches one then the Q delay is increasing"
"09-07","24:44","sharply okay it's it is uh close to Infinity that is uh that is the relationship"
"09-07","24:52","between current delay and the traffic intensity so it's like when you drive on"
"09-07","24:57","the road okay if there is no car you can see there's no car then of course we do not"
"09-07","25:02","have a lot of community but if there are a lot of occurs if there are lots of"
"09-07","25:08","cars then we may experience the queen delay okay"
"09-07","25:15","so when the traffic intensity is very very high then you have to be stuck on"
"09-07","25:20","the road for a long time okay so now let me give you a question to work on"
"09-07","25:45","so we have computer A and B and we have vouchers in between we have our package which has this is"
"09-07","25:51","the packet"
"09-07","26:06","okay we have l equals to 100 bits"
"09-07","26:12","R1 equals to"
"09-07","26:24","beats per second R1 equals to 20 actually equal to 10 and"
"09-07","26:30","R3 equals to 50 BPS okay these are the link capacity for"
"09-07","26:37","each link okay"
"09-07","26:56","so the current delay is 0.5 seconds at each router"
"09-07","27:09","thank you"
"09-07","27:29","another processing delay is one second at each router"
"09-07","27:34","foreign"
"09-07","27:51","A and B is 100 kilometer"
"09-07","27:56","okay the speed signal processing to be a signal propagation speed"
"09-07","28:03","equals to 25 kilometer per second"
"09-07","28:10","now I want you to calculate the total delay"
"09-07","28:16","equals to what so if you look at this"
"09-07","28:21","this is a formula here"
"09-07","28:26","this is wrong okay this is not total this is this is not uh know that this is total"
"09-07","28:32","the total delay equals to personal processing delay plus q a"
"09-07","28:38","please pay attention delay is the currently happened as all the routers"
"09-07","28:44","plus the transmission delay plus the propagation delay"
"09-07","28:51","okay so can you calculate this I will do this together with you but"
"09-07","28:58","hopefully when you review this video when you review this video please do the calculations on your own"
"09-07","29:05","okay because this may become a test question"
"09-07","29:11","we may have this in the exams okay so now we know the total delay equals to"
"09-07","29:19","four type of delays the transmission delay"
"09-07","29:24","Plus propagation delay Plus"
"09-07","29:30","current delay"
"09-07","29:35","plus the nodal processing delay"
"09-07","29:41","okay so then what is the total transmission delay"
"09-07","29:46","pay attention the transmission didn't happen at which places"
"09-07","29:52","at a we have to push it out as this router we have we have to push it out"
"09-07","29:58","okay at the second round should we have push it out again okay so then finally at the destination"
"09-07","30:05","do we need to put it out we do not okay we do not need to push it out at the"
"09-07","30:10","destination so then basically the transmission dealing happens at third places"
"09-07","30:16","a round Row one and round to two Okay so then that means"
"09-07","30:25","this is L over R1 that's the time we spend at a"
"09-07","30:32","plus l or R2 plus L over r 3. that's the"
"09-07","30:39","total transmission delay okay then what is the propagation delay"
"09-07","30:45","propagation delay is total distance"
"09-07","30:51","over the speed okay plus what is the queue"
"09-07","30:58","because 0.5 seconds at each router now how many"
"09-07","31:03","routers do we have we have two routers so we have that means two times D QE"
"09-07","31:15","okay plus no double percent delay again we have two routers"
"09-07","31:21","so at each round another percent delay is one second so that's why we have two times D nodal"
"09-07","31:30","okay then that means the next thing you do is just simple"
"09-07","31:35","calculation right so 100 over 20"
"09-07","31:40","0 over 10 plus 100 over 50. plus distance 100 over 25"
"09-07","31:49","Plus 2 times 0.5"
"09-07","31:56","okay this is"
"09-07","32:06","okay so then total you can see this is a 17"
"09-07","32:11","Plus 7 this is 24."
"09-07","32:20","17 plus 7 that is uh 24 seconds so I hope you can you really understand"
"09-07","32:27","this exercise okay because we are going to have a similar test problem in the"
"09-07","32:33","midterm or even final okay and then you may know you may want to"
"09-07","32:39","know how the delay really look like in real internet right so here in the"
"09-07","32:45","example we said oh okay the delay from A to B is 24 seconds but usually we do not"
"09-07","32:50","have that laundry that kind of long delay okay you already delays are very short"
"09-07","32:57","um actually there is a program called trace route which can provide the delay"
"09-07","33:03","measurement from the source to every router along the way towards the"
"09-07","33:10","destination okay um so this if you run this uh"
"09-07","33:16","program you are able to basically find out uh the delay from The Source"
"09-07","33:23","computer a to the first router the second router"
"09-07","33:29","the third voucher Etc and then finally to the destination B"
"09-07","33:35","okay so here is a how it looks like let's see let's first say how it will"
"09-07","33:41","look like and then we come back to see um uh to see um how this how this program"
"09-07","33:48","is designed okay so if you for example if you if this is the source computer"
"09-07","33:55","this is a and this is the destination B okay so then you can run a trace a route"
"09-07","34:02","program from A to B okay then you can see for each line for each row"
"09-07","34:10","here okay this this IP address is the IP address for"
"09-07","34:17","the first router along the way okay do you remember between A and B we have R"
"09-07","34:22","by R2 R3 L4 okay so from a to R1"
"09-07","34:29","so so basically this is c s j w is basically uh Gateway"
"09-07","34:36","it's probably a one round chart between A and B okay it's probably actually it's probably the first router along the way"
"09-07","34:43","okay and then you can see we provide three delay measurements from a kaya CTU"
"09-07","34:51","to this R1 router okay and the third delay environments are respectively One"
"09-07","34:58","MS one milliseconds one milliseconds and two milliseconds okay it's like through"
"09-07","35:04","twice three matters okay so then this means generally the time we"
"09-07","35:10","spend or the delay between a to the first router is about to one to two"
"09-07","35:18","milliseconds okay then from a to the the second line is about the second router"
"09-07","35:24","so from a to the second router is also around one two two uh milliseconds okay so then"
"09-07","35:34","from a to the third router is the third line so to the third router is about"
"09-07","35:40","five to six milliseconds so you can see the time is increasing"
"09-07","35:47","the time is increasing from us a small number to a bigger number that's because"
"09-07","35:54","the distance is longer and longer okay and you can also see interestingly here"
"09-07","36:02","so here you can see at the row seven the seventh row you can say from a to this"
"09-07","36:09","router um the time spent is about 22"
"09-07","36:14","milliseconds but then from a to the router at Indus"
"09-07","36:20","eight line okay in the eighth row then you can see the time is"
"09-07","36:25","significantly increased okay the time spent from a to that router is about 100"
"09-07","36:32","uh and five uh milliseconds so the time increase"
"09-07","36:38","significantly from about 22 to more than 100 why because most likely most likely"
"09-07","36:46","so there is a Trans Ocean leak a trans Oceanic link between these two routers"
"09-07","36:52","so that this link is super long that's why the delay is increased uh"
"09-07","36:59","significantly okay so and then you can see this will continue continue until"
"09-07","37:07","eventually this uh we we reached we reached the destination computer"
"09-07","37:14","okay we reached the destination and then then you can see the time here is"
"09-07","37:21","basically this the one-way time we spend from A to B this is not a round trip not"
"09-07","37:27","a round trip time this is a one-way time uh"
"09-07","37:33","I'm not sure if this is round trip or one way actually let's see let's see what is designed here"
"09-07","37:40","uh provide another one from sauce"
"09-07","37:49","between transmission oh okay sorry this is actually a round trip time okay this"
"09-07","37:54","is a round trip time that means from A to B and then from B to a okay the B"
"09-07","38:00","sent a response back to a and then this is a actually the round trip time"
"09-07","38:06","okay any questions"
"09-07","38:11","yeah he's asking is this the package is this package of Aging or circuit switching this is a package switching we"
"09-07","38:18","are talking about uh the internet okay so the circuit switching is now really"
"09-07","38:24","rarely used actually internet so when we talk about internet we are you we are"
"09-07","38:30","mainly referred to the package meeting which means the routers okay the router and switches"
"09-07","38:35","any other questions okay so that's how the face route"
"09-07","38:42","program works and and that's how the internet delays look like in reality"
"09-07","38:49","okay and then now we want to come back to a look at this uh program how this"
"09-07","38:55","program is designed how could this program provide the"
"09-07","39:00","round trip time or the time interval between the transmission and reply okay"
"09-07","39:06","so what happens is actually very interesting so every time"
"09-07","39:11","every time the computer a will send out"
"09-07","39:16","three packets okay you can see what you you may ask why do we send out three packets because"
"09-07","39:23","we want to measure three times so as you can see for every router we"
"09-07","39:30","measure three times because we want to know because one time sometimes may not be accurate right so we want to measure"
"09-07","39:37","multiple times to say like the average to to make sure uh the time can indeed"
"09-07","39:44","reflect the delays Okay so again"
"09-07","39:50","again so each time the round the computer a send out three packets and"
"09-07","39:56","this third package will reach firstly for example the first time these"
"09-07","40:02","three packets will reach computer router R1 okay and the interestingly the third"
"09-07","40:08","pack is all how some failed"
"09-07","40:14","the field is time to leave"
"09-07","40:21","we also call it TTL okay TTL is a very commonly used term in networking okay so"
"09-07","40:29","time to leave is one field in the packet okay in each packet each"
"09-07","40:36","packet uh has they all have a TTL field and for the first time the tkl field"
"09-07","40:43","is set to one what does this mean this means hey the"
"09-07","40:52","first three packets your time to leave is only one hop"
"09-07","40:58","okay that means when there's a third package arrive at router R1"
"09-07","41:05","okay R1 will directly minus one on the"
"09-07","41:12","current TTL so that means TTL minus 1 equal to 1"
"09-07","41:20","minus 1 equal to zero okay and then this router will check the TL and we'll see"
"09-07","41:26","oh this is zero okay that means what that means hate I'm sorry you through"
"09-07","41:34","you cannot live anymore because your time to leave is just one hop and now your TTL is zero so you cannot go"
"09-07","41:42","further you have to be dropped here okay that's how how R1 will react then"
"09-07","41:49","but but even these three packets die okay the R1 will still be very"
"09-07","41:56","responsible around will notify the parents of these three packets okay notify basically notify computer Aid say"
"09-07","42:03","hey I'm sorry you're through Pakistan okay so later on you will learn this is"
"09-07","42:09","actually uh done using some protocol for the icmp and then email finally received the"
"09-07","42:17","notification from Aaron saying those three packets died okay and then a we are write down the time"
"09-07","42:26","of receiving the response so then it will calculate"
"09-07","42:32","the time between the transmission of these three packets and the response"
"09-07","42:38","from R1 okay or all the time when it receives"
"09-07","42:43","the response from R1 so then this time interval is called the round trip time so a will write down that time that's"
"09-07","42:50","why you can see actually here you can see for the third package okay"
"09-07","42:58","you have three time intervals to write down okay this these are all recorded by computer Aid and the second time so"
"09-07","43:06","second time a will try again okay a will try I'll try to send out"
"09-07","43:11","three packets again the second time the TTL is set to two"
"09-07","43:17","okay set to two two means these packets can travel two hops so when they arrive"
"09-07","43:25","at R1 foreign"
"09-07","43:36","on the current TTL so equal to 2 minus y equal to 1. then this means the"
"09-07","43:43","uh TTL is not zero that means these three packets can still go forward okay"
"09-07","43:48","so then when they arrive and then this third practice arrive at R2 R2 will do"
"09-07","44:00","the current TTL which is one okay minus one equal to zero there are two will say"
"09-07","44:08","I'm sorry you have to you have to uh stop here okay I have to drop you then"
"09-07","44:14","again R2 will notify a about the dropping of these three packets so it"
"09-07","44:20","will write down the time uh of receiving the response and the time of"
"09-07","44:25","transmission will cost then calculate the time interval will be turned down okay that's how the delay is between a"
"09-07","44:31","to R2 is uh calculated so basically these three numbers okay then you can"
"09-07","44:39","imagine they can continue the next time anybody has to send out the third package again with TTL equal"
"09-07","44:47","to Third and then when it arrives at R1 with minus one TTL minus one then dtl"
"09-07","44:54","becomes two so it continues to R2 then t r 2 will do TTL minus one again make it"
"09-07","45:01","TTL into one okay then it will finally reach our third and then after will do"
"09-07","45:07","TTL minus one equals to zero okay so then after we'll drop the third package"
"09-07","45:14","and notify Anya will record the time interval and then that is the time for"
"09-07","45:20","this okay so then we continue and eventually the third package will arrive"
"09-07","45:27","at the destination okay then uh the choice routes program"
"09-07","45:33","will stop okay that's how it works any questions"
"09-09","0:04","is this all clear"
"09-09","0:12","okay good thanks so that's the choice drugs program as I"
"09-09","0:19","said later we are going to uh we will see how this is implementing icmp but uh"
"09-09","0:26","but this this is generally the design okay the design of this uh this uh"
"09-09","0:32","um program and then you can see how the international internet delay"
"09-09","0:38","um look like in reality okay and for packing loss I think we can skip"
"09-09","0:45","this part because we mentioned the packet loss happens because"
"09-09","0:51","the buffer of the router is full okay so this is the only thing you need to know"
"09-09","0:56","we have to drop this uh the incoming package when the buffer is a full that's how packet loss"
"09-09","1:03","happens okay and this may again be the uh test question"
"09-09","1:09","then the next thing we are going to look at is the throughput okay"
"09-09","1:14","so throughput in general this uh the definition is the rate at which these"
"09-09","1:20","are transferred between the sender and the receiver okay of course we may have instantaneous"
"09-09","1:27","throughput okay which means the read at a given point in time okay and we may"
"09-09","1:33","also have the average throughput for example you you can calculate within one hour"
"09-09","1:40","okay how many how much how many bits are sent from this sender to the receiver"
"09-09","1:48","okay then we can calculate that Our Roots output okay and then the"
"09-09","1:53","instantaneous uh throughput may be very high at one point but maybe low at the"
"09-09","1:59","other point the average throughput is like it's a it's usually"
"09-09","2:04","um fixed okay um then but the throughput is also"
"09-09","2:11","determined by the link okay is determined by the length so for"
"09-09","2:18","example now if we have a sender and receiver"
"09-09","2:23","okay a center of the receiver then the sender wants to send some beats"
"09-09","2:30","to the receiver and this package the package may have to go through a number"
"09-09","2:35","of links okay you can see in the middle is actually a router okay and then we"
"09-09","2:40","may have the link at the left Link at the right okay so this these links may"
"09-09","2:46","have different capacities do you remember do you remember we learned this before we talked about different type of"
"09-09","2:53","links before right we have fibers which may have a very high link capacity we"
"09-09","2:59","have Wi-Fi or even mobile network which may have a very low link capacity"
"09-09","3:07","okay so it's different then how can we determine the hourly"
"09-09","3:13","throughput in this case or the effective algorithm throughput okay so now you can"
"09-09","3:20","imagine now you can imagine these two links are like the pipes carrying the"
"09-09","3:26","water okay the left pipe has a one rate the second second the"
"09-09","3:34","right pipe has another rate so what that means one pipe may be very very narrow"
"09-09","3:39","it carries the water and the water can flow very very slowly"
"09-09","3:46","but the other pipe may be very wide okay then the water can flow very fast"
"09-09","3:54","Okay then if this is a P1 pipe one this is P2 and the window P1 is very very"
"09-09","4:03","narrow P2 is very wide so let me ask you a question"
"09-09","4:08","the speed of this water flow from the computer A to B"
"09-09","4:15","so the flow the speed of this water flow is determined"
"09-09","4:22","by by P1 or P2 if P1 is very narrow P2 is very wide"
"09-09","4:34","let me repeat the question again if P1 is very narrow P2 is very wide"
"09-09","4:39","then the speed of the water flow between A and B is determined by P1 or P2"
"09-09","4:49","P1 great excellent I I also say the answers from the chat yes it is actually"
"09-09","4:56","determined by P1 by the one which has the smaller"
"09-09","5:04","um read or the smaller throughput right so this is exactly the same thing"
"09-09","5:11","in the networking in the networking if we have a link which has a small bandwidth and another link which has a"
"09-09","5:18","higher bandwidth okay then the effective throughput is actually determined by the"
"09-09","5:26","one with smaller bandwidth okay"
"09-09","5:31","question answer question is that the same as download speed you I think you are mentioning uh the throughput"
"09-09","5:40","um you also said bandwidth so throughput here equals to"
"09-09","5:45","um is like um is how many bits we can carry of"
"09-09","5:51","course the downloading speed the downloading speed can be measured by the throughput okay but I do not see they"
"09-09","5:58","are exactly the same because we also have uploading speed right okay"
"09-09","6:04","um so bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth is uh very related to throughput okay but"
"09-09","6:13","as you can see here when we see bandwidth we we mean the bandwidth for specific link for example for P1 we may"
"09-09","6:20","have a benefit of RS for P2 we may have bandwidth of RC"
"09-09","6:26","okay but the throughput is actually determined by the one with the the one"
"09-09","6:33","the smaller parameter I would say okay the smaller bandwidth"
"09-09","6:38","is this clear to everybody"
"09-09","6:43","okay good so then now you can look at this example in this example if RS is smaller than RC"
"09-09","6:52","okay RS is uh is the capacity being capacity or the bandwidth"
"09-09","6:58","foreign the left link and RC is for the right link so then in this case"
"09-09","7:07","sorry in this case what is the average n through end-to-end throughput or the"
"09-09","7:12","effective end-to-end throughput that is RS okay how about if RS is bigger than"
"09-09","7:19","RC when RS is bigger than RC"
"09-09","7:24","in this case then what is the average end to end through to order the"
"09-09","7:30","effective entry throughput excellent you are all choosing the smaller one okay some of you may think"
"09-09","7:37","oh the bigger one is on the left then probably it can be faster no even I mean"
"09-09","7:44","if you again imagine if this is water even the left side we can flow in the"
"09-09","7:50","water very fast okay but when it comes down to a narrower pipe"
"09-09","7:56","the water speed has to slow down has to decrease that's why"
"09-09","8:02","again the effective end-to-end throughput is still determined by the"
"09-09","8:07","smaller one okay that's why it's RC excellent so then we can say"
"09-09","8:14","um those ones like rsrc the smaller one is or the smallest one is actually"
"09-09","8:20","called the boat neck bottleneck link okay which means"
"09-09","8:27","um the link on the end to end path that constraints the end-to-end throughput"
"09-09","8:34","okay with this bottleneck link usually has the smallest link capacity or the"
"09-09","8:42","smallest bandwidth okay so that's why uh when you think"
"09-09","8:47","about uh for example when you are talking to another computer while your computer is talking to another computer"
"09-09","8:53","far away you can never predict what happens in between right so there may be one Link"
"09-09","8:59","in between okay with that constraints the end-to-end throughput okay then in this"
"09-09","9:05","case it may um affect your network okay but the good"
"09-09","9:11","thing the good thing is that we have we also have the rocking algorithm okay that our routing"
"09-09","9:18","algorithm is going to matter the delays between two hops okay like between two routers"
"09-09","9:24","if this link is not fast enough if this link has a very very long delay okay"
"09-09","9:31","then the router routing algorithm will will try to roll out this uh delay roll"
"09-09","9:39","out to this link okay it will not include this link into the path that's how we can mitigate this problem okay"
"09-09","9:50","um this is another scenario in this scenario you can see we have about 10 connections okay between"
"09-09","9:58","these 10 computers and these 10 computers can help out 10 connections"
"09-09","10:04","and then you can see for each path"
"09-09","10:10","each path is each part includes basically three segments so the first segments the first"
"09-09","10:17","link okay it has RS the second link"
"09-09","10:25","okay the second link is actually determined by what by the total number of links"
"09-09","10:33","okay so we know in total this is our the bandwidth is R but this is shared by by"
"09-09","10:40","10 paths okay so that's why by 10 links that's why actually each one each link"
"09-09","10:48","can only get a tenth of work okay and then third portion we have we"
"09-09","10:55","have RC then in this case in this case if I ask you what is the effective end-to-end"
"09-09","11:02","throughput between a and b so what would be the answer"
"09-09","11:08","what do you think what is the effective end-to-end throughput between a and b"
"09-09","11:17","again again we know one thing for sure we need to choose the smallest one right"
"09-09","11:24","we need to choose the smallest one among these two because the smallest one is"
"09-09","11:29","the botnet link okay the bottleneck link so that's why actually the average or the effective"
"09-09","11:37","end to end throughput is the minimum of RC RS and R Overton whichever is the"
"09-09","11:45","smallest okay then that one will become the effective end-to-end robot"
"09-09","11:52","what about throughputs between routers okay if we come back to this"
"09-09","11:59","to this um slide so"
"09-09","12:05","actually this is uh this uh the the computer A and B are connected"
"09-09","12:12","uh we uh are connected by those vouchers okay so when we say we want to find the"
"09-09","12:19","smallest one okay that means uh those links are actually divided by the"
"09-09","12:25","routers so now for example if we have computer a foreign"
"09-09","12:35","so for example"
"09-09","12:44","okay so then you can see if we have"
"09-09","12:58","so if these are the links the link capacity between a and uh"
"09-09","13:07","R1 R1 and r2r201 R3 and utterance B then"
"09-09","13:13","you can see a mod can you tell me what is the effective end-to-end throughput"
"09-09","13:19","on this path first one is 10 second one is the five third one is 20 BPS the last one is 100"
"09-09","13:27","BPS so what is the"
"09-09","13:32","effective and to end the robot between A and B can you tell me in this"
"09-09","13:40","example now choosing five that's correct if you want to say for example what is the"
"09-09","13:45","effective N20 slope would be turned R1 and R3 then I would say"
"09-09","13:51","between R1 and R3 we have 5 and 20. so I would say 5 is"
"09-09","14:00","the one okay but usually we we will look at only the end to end which means computer to computer"
"09-09","14:06","okay from A to B yes that's something that can be manually assigned by the"
"09-09","14:13","router or the router automatically assigning those links"
"09-09","14:18","um no that is not determined by the router okay that is actually determined"
"09-09","14:25","by the infrastructure so for example if this this is if a is"
"09-09","14:32","your home computer okay then you are connecting to your router using"
"09-09","14:39","something and this can be"
"09-09","14:46","this can be Wi-Fi this can be"
"09-09","14:54","internet if you are using a cable okay so then because you are using different"
"09-09","15:00","ways to connect to the router then the speed is different the ethernet is probably much faster than the Wi-Fi"
"09-09","15:07","okay the internet has the that link that cable has much higher capacity or more"
"09-09","15:14","higher bandwidth do this make sense then between R1 and R2"
"09-09","15:21","depending on what internet service provider you are using probably you are"
"09-09","15:27","using Comcast and atnt may claim say hey there we are providing fiber then if"
"09-09","15:35","they are providing fiber then their their link bandwidth is much higher than the ones from Comcast"
"09-09","15:42","okay so it really depends on what kind of links do you use to connect those"
"09-09","15:49","ruptures or the computers okay those are all great questions so then"
"09-09","15:54","you can see it has nothing to do with the routers it's basically purely uh"
"09-09","15:59","related to the link types if it is in the test I give you some"
"09-09","16:06","questions like this I hope you know how to calculate the"
"09-09","16:11","end-to-end throughput actually you don't need to do any calculation just through the smallest one but still in a in a"
"09-09","16:18","test in the previous exams I still saw a lot of students doing calculations okay"
"09-09","16:25","so for example if I if for this example if I ask you what is the average throughput between a and b"
"09-09","16:31","okay you know what many students would do 10 plus 5 plus 20 plus 100 divided by"
"09-09","16:38","four that is something you should definitely avoid okay it's not calculated in that"
"09-09","16:45","way it's actually just um determined by the smallest one"
"09-09","16:52","okay pay attention to that unless this continue to discuss the"
"09-09","16:57","protocol layers okay so"
"09-09","17:03","um I have been mentioning this layer thing for a long time okay I mentioned this"
"09-09","17:09","again again but why do we have protocol leaders what does this mean okay so if"
"09-09","17:14","you think about the networking the networks are actually very complex okay"
"09-09","17:20","it has a lot of different components and pieces you think about this we have the"
"09-09","17:25","the host the links and we turn the links so we have we have the routers the"
"09-09","17:30","switches and we may also have different applications you are running email you"
"09-09","17:36","are using web service you are using file transferring right and then we also have"
"09-09","17:42","different protocols okay we know those are like rules to follow all the standards"
"09-09","17:48","um to control uh the different components and we also have the hardware"
"09-09","17:53","the software so how how can we you can see these are"
"09-09","17:58","different pieces here and there scattered right so how can we combine or integrate these different"
"09-09","18:06","pieces to make it work in just one internet okay this is actually a very challenging"
"09-09","18:13","problem right a very challenging problem then the question is is there any hope"
"09-09","18:19","of organizing the structural Network okay or at least the one we discuss something"
"09-09","18:26","for example we just discuss application or when we discuss a protocol what are"
"09-09","18:32","we referring to okay so so we we at least have some"
"09-09","18:37","Foundation or some kind of framework for us to to start the discussion so that is"
"09-09","18:43","actually the problem for networking okay that's why uh graduate people"
"09-09","18:51","um propose one uh model called OSI model OKAY Open"
"09-09","18:58","System interconnection model which contains seven layers the seven layers"
"09-09","19:03","are actually uh uh it's uh it's like an analogy to The Postal Service"
"09-09","19:11","okay so let's look at the Postal Service uh when you write a letter to a foreign"
"09-09","19:17","country for example okay so for first level course you need to write this 20 Page Letter"
"09-09","19:23","if I'm writing let's see a letter to my friend in China okay I may write in"
"09-09","19:29","English but he or she can only understand Chinese okay when you are writing a 20-page"
"09-09","19:36","letter this is like application layer the first thing you need to do but this letter has to be translated"
"09-09","19:43","so the receiver can read it this is what we call as presentation layer then when"
"09-09","19:50","it comes down we need to ensure the recipient can indeed receive the letter"
"09-09","19:56","okay how can we make sure he or she receives this okay we need to"
"09-09","20:01","establish some kind of session okay so that's the session layer then down below"
"09-09","20:07","okay down below one way when we have this like this 20 Page Letter"
"09-09","20:12","okay we need to separate and number of the pages why because sometimes for example uh"
"09-09","20:21","the Postal Service may not be able to carry a huge letter a long letter 20"
"09-09","20:26","pages right so you make you may only be able to send just one or two pages per"
"09-09","20:32","letter right so that's why you have to separate it into smaller pieces and then"
"09-09","20:38","maybe deliver it deliver you for example if we separate these 20 pages into uh in"
"09-09","20:45","20 pages into uh 10 different pieces so each piece has 20 has two pages okay"
"09-09","20:52","then those those 10 pieces will be sent out individually"
"09-09","20:59","okay individually so then this layer is called transport layer we separate and"
"09-09","21:04","number the pages okay um and we also need to make sure what if"
"09-09","21:09","some of the pieces are um lost what should we do how can we recover okay"
"09-09","21:15","this is also done as transport layer then down below is the network layer"
"09-09","21:21","Network layer basically means uh the Postal Center is sorting the letters by the zip code to Route them closer to the"
"09-09","21:28","destination so what is the shortest path from uh from you to your friend okay"
"09-09","21:33","that's the network layer and then one layer below is the local postal office"
"09-09","21:39","need to determine which vehicles are used to deliver the Legends okay"
"09-09","21:44","eventually we have the physical layer the physical layer is to"
"09-09","21:50","um is to carry the letter between different stations to to do delivery"
"09-09","21:55","using uh the the physical tracks the planes the real uh reels or the uh cars"
"09-09","22:04","okay so then that is a as the lowest layer we need to determine how we can"
"09-09","22:10","carry this letter between your place to post the first post office and from the"
"09-09","22:16","first person to the second puzzle second possible to the last one okay so it's uh"
"09-09","22:22","it's like that so this is how the analogy is done that's how the seven"
"09-09","22:27","layers are um extracted okay so the examinators are"
"09-09","22:32","application presentation session transport network data link and physical layer so if you want to remember these"
"09-09","22:39","seven years you can remember this all people seem to need data processing so you can look at the first letter okay"
"09-09","22:47","why do we need to uh have this kind of a layer okay um or is there a uh is there another"
"09-09","22:54","analogy for the layering so actually the error travel is a very good analogy for"
"09-09","23:00","the layering um if you think about the air travel usually you need to do the uh ticketing"
"09-09","23:06","right take it you you buy the ticket and then the next thing is you you need"
"09-09","23:13","to check in your bag and you go to the gates and then the plane take off then"
"09-09","23:19","the plane will do the routing and finally the plane arrives at this destination then we will have landing"
"09-09","23:26","and then gate you need to go to the Gates Again you need to claim the baggage uh usually we don't don't do"
"09-09","23:34","complaining that take it right but anyway um so you can see it's like a layer kind"
"09-09","23:40","of thing right here so why do we do this kind of layering"
"09-09","23:48","you think about this uh one one very important benefits okay one very"
"09-09","23:55","important benefit is the layering is providing a kind of"
"09-09","24:00","service to the other layers okay so for example for example"
"09-09","24:06","um the let's say the gates okay the guess is"
"09-09","24:13","like uh it's like providing service to the baggage part okay so that means okay"
"09-09","24:19","uh I need to I need to uh for example if one day you want to change your ticket"
"09-09","24:24","okay or if one day once you say um you want to"
"09-09","24:30","uh yes you want to change the ticket you you want to change the destination do you need to like worry about if the"
"09-09","24:39","airport has already uh processed your gate correctly so you don't need to"
"09-09","24:44","worry about that right so the gate itself is providing the service to the app layers select that okay"
"09-09","24:52","um and also you don't need to once your bag is clean is checked in you don't need to worry about the case also so"
"09-09","24:58","it's like that um basically one layer will provide a service to the other layers and these"
"09-09","25:04","layers are actually kind of isolated from each other um I should not say isolated but they"
"09-09","25:10","are independent from each other okay so if one layer is changed so for example"
"09-09","25:15","one day if we want to change um a routine of airplane we say okay we"
"09-09","25:21","don't want the plane to go through um Los Angeles you want to to go through"
"09-09","25:27","Chicago then it doesn't change it this routine changing doesn't change your"
"09-09","25:33","ticket okay uh your tickets the destination is still the same The Source"
"09-09","25:38","uh is still the same okay so it's like that um"
"09-09","25:44","so this is a the lettering that's that is actually one very important benefit I hope you understand"
"09-09","25:50","um another another um benefit is uh we as we said the computer networking is actually a very"
"09-09","25:57","complex system if we want to explicitly mention something or referring to"
"09-09","26:03","something okay then we need to um have something to refer to okay we"
"09-09","26:09","need to have some kind of a framework or reference model to identify the"
"09-09","26:16","different pieces different components in the networking okay so that's why we"
"09-09","26:21","need such kind of really uh layering okay so for example we can see when we talk about the email applications we met"
"09-09","26:28","when we talk about the service web services the web pages the web browsers"
"09-09","26:34","Etc you can say oh this is a application letter thing okay but when we talk about"
"09-09","26:40","the let's say reliable data transfer um when we talk about the sockets"
"09-09","26:48","then we should know oh okay that that belongs to the transporter layer similarly when we talk about the routine"
"09-09","26:54","algorithm um then we need to we we say oh okay this belongs to the"
"09-09","27:00","um uh the network layer okay so it's like that that's uh that's uh why we we"
"09-09","27:06","uh it's very important to have a explicit structure uh for"
"09-09","27:12","um reference okay uh the second thing we have mentioned the Hassan benefits is that we need to"
"09-09","27:19","help this kind of modularization this is very easy for"
"09-09","27:24","um for maintenance and for updating of the system why because if you want to"
"09-09","27:30","change the implementation of one layer it doesn't affect the other layers okay you don't need to change the other"
"09-09","27:37","layers implementation correspondingly that is the benefits uh but there is one"
"09-09","27:43","question for you to consider is the layering considered harmful"
"09-09","27:48","is this a 100 good thing is there any drawbacks for layering"
"09-09","27:56","can you think of any if you can you can type in the chat"
"09-09","28:07","you all think later is 100 good there might be counts yes"
"09-09","28:14","yes there might be consider them what are the potential accounts you can think of"
"09-09","28:24","too cohesive okay yeah good point"
"09-09","28:30","must be same standard right right okay"
"09-09","28:37","so I I think uh what you mean is uh within a layer we need to have the same"
"09-09","28:43","standard right"
"09-09","28:48","uh those are all good points very good so let me give you some hints if you"
"09-09","28:54","think about the layering uh the good thing is oh okay when we"
"09-09","28:59","refer to something we can always find a layer to to refer to right but the the"
"09-09","29:06","drawback is that also means if you want to refer to"
"09-09","29:11","something okay if you have something you want to refer to then you must put it into a layer okay you must put it into a"
"09-09","29:19","layer in order to refer to that okay so by you if you think about some"
"09-09","29:25","of the new features or new things we we consider in networking for example"
"09-09","29:31","when network was firstly uh designed nobody considered about security okay"
"09-09","29:37","security no layer is dealing with security there is no security layer right then we may"
"09-09","29:44","implement but now security becomes a problem when we implement this how which"
"09-09","29:49","layer should we put security okay should we put this to application"
"09-09","29:55","layer to transport layer or network layer you see that it fits over but"
"09-09","30:01","I mean it doesn't belong to any of these layers okay that is the actually the um"
"09-09","30:08","obviously the drawbacks or the counts uh of the layering thing okay that means if"
"09-09","30:15","you have some new components coming up due to the development of Technology you"
"09-09","30:20","need to you need to fit this new component into a specific layer but"
"09-09","30:26","sometimes this might be very difficult okay that's one thing you can you can"
"09-09","30:31","think about all right any any questions"
"09-09","30:39","okay so we talk about the seven layers of OSI"
"09-09","30:44","model but the question is in Internet do we really implemented those seven years"
"09-09","30:51","do we really have all those seven layers application presentation session"
"09-09","30:58","transport Network link physical do we have all those layers the answer is no"
"09-09","31:04","actually in real internet we only have uh I'll see in the internet protocols"
"09-09","31:11","that we have about five layers we have only five layers purely okay so for"
"09-09","31:16","example we have uh we have application layer transport layer Network layer link"
"09-09","31:22","layer physical layer as shown on the slide but we do not have the"
"09-09","31:28","presentation layer and the session layer"
"09-09","31:41","so these two layers are missing actually"
"09-09","31:48","again this may become a test problem I may ask you in the test what are the two"
"09-09","31:53","layers missing in the Internet Protocol stack okay"
"09-09","31:58","good question why are they missing why are they missing because in the in"
"09-09","32:05","the implementation okay during the implementation they found these two layers are sometimes optional and not"
"09-09","32:12","really necessary for the for the protocol for for the implementation okay"
"09-09","32:19","so gradually then people um think okay when if we if we want to"
"09-09","32:25","do if we want to implement some of the functionalities of presentation and session we can directly put them into"
"09-09","32:32","the application layer okay so that's why uh I mean it's it's"
"09-09","32:38","kind of a uh design uh design kind of thing so"
"09-09","32:44","that's the main reason why we do not all the information implementation kind of thing that's why we do not really have"
"09-09","32:51","these two layers uh in the Internet Protocol set okay"
"09-09","32:56","uh so basically gradually people realize okay if we have one message okay we can"
"09-09","33:03","break it into smaller pieces then there's some Breaking part is done as a"
"09-09","33:08","transport layer okay if you do not have any need I will doing uh translation"
"09-09","33:13","okay and you need a session because transport layer is also uh it's kind of"
"09-09","33:19","establishing a connection so some of the functionalities are kind of duplicate in"
"09-09","33:24","the other layers okay um so that's the main reason and now you"
"09-09","33:30","can say for the application layer the application layer is meaning to support the network applications as we said we"
"09-09","33:38","may have different applications and for each type of application it may use a specific"
"09-09","33:46","protocol okay for example FTP here is for trial file transfer file transfer"
"09-09","33:53","protocol this is the meaning for the file transferring service okay the SMTP SMTP"
"09-09","34:02","is a simple mail transfer protocol this is used for email service and HTTP you"
"09-09","34:08","are probably very familiar with the right so HTTP is used for web service"
"09-09","34:13","okay so you can see different application use different protocols"
"09-09","34:19","and then at transport layer we also have two types of protocols one type of TCP"
"09-09","34:25","the other type is UDP okay so TCP and udpr"
"09-09","34:30","um a very different and we're going to deal uh we are going to spend quite some time discussing these two type of TC uh"
"09-09","34:38","protocols so this is mainly dealing with the process to process data transfer"
"09-09","34:44","probably you for now you do not have the ideal process yet okay we are going to"
"09-09","34:50","screen more about this but anyway you need to know okay we have at least two type of protocols that"
"09-09","34:55","transporter layer the network layer we also have different protocols we have at"
"09-09","35:01","least we have IP protocol IP is used to determine for example the IP address how"
"09-09","35:08","is how IP address is uh is uh defined okay and we also have the"
"09-09","35:16","different routing protocols for networking okay we are going to discuss more about that the link layer we have"
"09-09","35:22","the ethernet which is for usually for the cable network okay and we also also"
"09-09","35:29","have the wireless now 80211 like Wi-Fi for wireless network so these are also"
"09-09","35:36","different tools of course there are more okay um like Bluetooth mobile networks"
"09-09","35:43","and then physically physically is basically the piece on The Wire the"
"09-09","35:48","zeros and the ones okay and if you if you look at this if we do not if we"
"09-09","35:53","ignore the physical layer okay if you look at the upper four layers"
"09-09","35:58","each layer has some protocols okay reside in that layer that's why we"
"09-09","36:06","call this as Internet Protocol stack okay and in the future also in the test"
"09-09","36:12","I may give you an application so for example I may say okay for HTTP that's"
"09-09","36:18","the application now what is the protocol used at the application layer you know it is HTTP right for web service and"
"09-09","36:26","then what is the protocol used for transport layer you can see this is uh this may be TCP okay and then what is"
"09-09","36:32","the protocol as the narrow player and say this is IP and what is the protocol nuclear this may be ethernet maybe Wi-Fi"
"09-09","36:39","okay so as you can see in order to support"
"09-09","36:44","foreign service okay"
"09-09","36:49","we need a a bunch of protocols actually okay from application layer to the link"
"09-09","36:55","layer so HTTP TCP IP or 80211 okay then"
"09-09","37:02","this is uh this is how the Internet Protocol stack is used to support this"
"09-09","37:09","map service okay that is the general idea for Internet Protocol stack"
"09-09","37:16","um and then you may you may ask so how about the other two layers in the OSI"
"09-09","37:21","model the presentation layer and the session layer okay so pay attention that again"
"09-09","37:28","reference model is just for reference it's like a framework but the protocol stack is a is the reality is what we use"
"09-09","37:37","in reality is for the real implementation okay so if you want to uh do some kind some"
"09-09","37:45","functionalities from the presentation layer and session layer okay so you may"
"09-09","37:51","do it in the application layer uh so for example if you want to do some encryption or comprehension compression"
"09-09","37:58","okay or do some machine specific conversions then in this case it's like"
"09-09","38:04","to interpret the meaning of the data right so then we can have some"
"09-09","38:11","functionalities implemented in the application layer okay uh to complete"
"09-09","38:17","those functions for example we all know that when you develop some application you can"
"09-09","38:23","call some encryption library right to do the encryption decryption so it's it's"
"09-09","38:29","like that and then for session layer session layer is used you usually used for a"
"09-09","38:36","synchronization uh checkpointing the recovery of data exchange okay so this"
"09-09","38:42","is uh obviously this part is um is uh actually implemented in the transporter"
"09-09","38:49","layer and the um yeah mainly the transporter layer actually for a data reliable data"
"09-09","38:57","transfer okay and of course the error checking those kind of thing uh"
"09-09","39:03","synchronization kind of thing is actually done at the link layer also okay different layer"
"09-09","39:10","they all have this kind of functionalities um okay so and again pay attention these"
"09-09","39:17","two layers are missing questions so far"
"09-09","39:24","whose hand are those handled by the application layer"
"09-09","39:29","or by the end systems uh so as I mentioned uh pay attention let's that"
"09-09","39:35","there is some very important thing I want to discuss here so we are talking about the Internet"
"09-09","39:41","Protocol stack here okay and the application layer"
"09-09","39:47","when we talk about the apple and the system you you may you should ask yourself what kind of what which layers"
"09-09","39:54","which layers are included in the end systems when we see the end system we"
"09-09","40:00","basically mean the devices right the um"
"09-09","40:05","computers the mobile phones Etc actually in reality the end system those"
"09-09","40:12","devices contain all the layers from application layer to"
"09-09","40:18","transport layer to network layer to link layer to physically all the layers are included in the end systems okay"
"09-09","40:25","because as you can you can think about on your computer we have the applications right we have the emails"
"09-09","40:32","the web browsers and then those messages messages need to be sent need to go"
"09-09","40:38","through the transport layer Network learning layer and I I'll explain more and you have a better idea about how"
"09-09","40:45","this happened but anyway the Ender system can hear all this okay"
"09-09","40:50","but the routers the routers have only had have only"
"09-09","40:57","three layers the routers have only up to network"
"09-09","41:02","clear the physical layer link layer Network layer okay that is uh for the router so when we talk about uh where is"
"09-09","41:12","uh the application the presentation layer functionality implemented we can see this is implementing application"
"09-09","41:19","layer okay then that means the application layer basically means it's most likely in an assistant"
"09-09","41:26","okay because routers do not have application here but for the session layer it's different"
"09-09","41:32","a second layer um the functionality is defined are like synchronization checkpointing recovery"
"09-09","41:39","of data exchange Etc then for those functionalities those are implemented in"
"09-09","41:45","multiple layers okay for example synchronization can be done at nuclear then link layer basically means uh it"
"09-09","41:54","may be in the in the systems and it may be in the routers does this make sense"
"09-09","42:01","okay yeah so so it's a like like it's an assistant and the"
"09-09","42:07","the uh the layer stack and the protocol stack is like two different uh Concepts"
"09-09","42:14","okay so we need to clarify that okay all right so that"
"09-12","0:04","yeah so so it's a like like it's another"
"09-12","0:07","systems and the"
"09-12","0:09","the uh the layer stack and the protocol"
"09-12","0:13","stack is like two different uh Concepts"
"09-12","0:16","okay so we need to clarify that"
"09-12","0:19","okay all right so that let's look at one"
"09-12","0:24","example and then after this example you"
"09-12","0:27","probably can understand the"
"09-12","0:28","encapsulation much better okay in cap"
"09-12","0:31","solution and also how the internet works"
"09-12","0:33","okay much better you have a better idea"
"09-12","0:35","so as I said as I said as you can see"
"09-12","0:38","here we have a computer"
"09-12","0:41","a"
"09-12","0:43","computer B and switch S and a router are"
"09-12","0:50","okay then"
"09-12","0:53","as I mentioned as I mentioned in the"
"09-12","0:56","devices and systems we have all five"
"09-12","0:58","layers as you can see in a and b"
"09-12","1:01","they have application layer to physical"
"09-12","1:03","year"
"09-12","1:04","okay"
"09-12","1:05","then the writers only have three layers"
"09-12","1:09","physical layer link layer and network"
"09-12","1:11","layer switch has only two layers link"
"09-12","1:14","layer and physically okay so for now we"
"09-12","1:16","don't need to know why later in later"
"09-12","1:19","chapters we are going to explain more"
"09-12","1:21","okay but now I just want you to know"
"09-12","1:25","how can we send a message how could this"
"09-12","1:28","message be delivered okay how would this"
"09-12","1:31","work"
"09-12","1:32","so here"
"09-12","1:34","um there is one concept means"
"09-12","1:36","encapsulation and I'll explain uh more"
"09-12","1:39","about that okay so firstly if one day"
"09-12","1:43","you want to send a message this message"
"09-12","1:45","can be a email message can be a HTTP"
"09-12","1:48","request message for example if you want"
"09-12","1:50","to request for a web page whatever so"
"09-12","1:53","let's just assume this is a like like a"
"09-12","1:55","email okay email message then we have a"
"09-12","1:58","message app so this m pay attention this"
"09-12","2:02","m is at application layer okay you"
"09-12","2:06","basically you open your outlook you type"
"09-12","2:08","in a message then that's some okay"
"09-12","2:11","as I mentioned this message is usually"
"09-12","2:14","very big"
"09-12","2:15","okay your labor big of course it may be"
"09-12","2:18","super small but we have to uh usually we"
"09-12","2:21","have to break it into smaller pieces"
"09-12","2:23","okay after we break it into smaller"
"09-12","2:26","pieces"
"09-12","2:28","so here in this animation it doesn't"
"09-12","2:30","show that we break M into smaller pieces"
"09-12","2:34","but you should know you should know that"
"09-12","2:36","your lady we will do this kind of uh"
"09-12","2:38","breaking okay"
"09-12","2:41","and then this now the M comes down to"
"09-12","2:46","the transporter layer or a piece of M"
"09-12","2:48","comes down to transport layer okay"
"09-12","2:51","then transport layer is is like uh as we"
"09-12","2:54","said it will do the"
"09-12","2:56","um it will"
"09-12","2:58","um add some information okay it will add"
"09-12","3:01","some thing like transporter layer header"
"09-12","3:04","okay so header you can imagine this as"
"09-12","3:08","uh the envelope"
"09-12","3:10","okay so the message is like you you have"
"09-12","3:13","a several pages of a letter and now when"
"09-12","3:16","it comes to transporter layer we need to"
"09-12","3:18","add one layer of envelope okay on this"
"09-12","3:23","envelope we will write down some"
"09-12","3:25","information like"
"09-12","3:26","uh what is The Source process what the"
"09-12","3:29","destination process okay it's like uh I"
"09-12","3:33","need to write down oh this is from uh"
"09-12","3:35","showian sun to let's say to Michael"
"09-12","3:39","okay so it's like that so I need to"
"09-12","3:41","specify who is the sender who's the"
"09-12","3:44","receiver who is the signing process"
"09-12","3:46","who's the receiving process okay of"
"09-12","3:48","course there are more information in the"
"09-12","3:50","header you don't need to know what is in"
"09-12","3:52","the header yet okay but here you can say"
"09-12","3:55","okay I add some header it's called HT"
"09-12","3:58","okay and then now this entire thing"
"09-12","4:02","is called a segment or datagram"
"09-12","4:06","depending on what kind of protocol"
"09-12","4:07","you're using if you're using UDP then"
"09-12","4:10","that's datagram if you are using TCP"
"09-12","4:12","then that's called segment but usually"
"09-12","4:14","we just call segmented transport layer"
"09-12","4:16","okay"
"09-12","4:17","then again this message needs to travel"
"09-12","4:21","down this now this segment needs to"
"09-12","4:24","travel down to another layer below why"
"09-12","4:28","because we need to send it out right so"
"09-12","4:31","then we I mean it comes down to another"
"09-12","4:34","layer to the network layer we need to"
"09-12","4:37","add some"
"09-12","4:38","Network a little header it's like we are"
"09-12","4:43","adding another envelope outside"
"09-12","4:46","the envelope of a transpose layer does"
"09-12","4:49","this make sense"
"09-12","4:51","so we add another let me wrap it again"
"09-12","4:54","okay and this time on the on the outer"
"09-12","4:58","outside or outside envelope we will we"
"09-12","5:03","will uh write down some information"
"09-12","5:05","about the IP address"
"09-12","5:08","so this is from uh Sacramento to some"
"09-12","5:14","place in in New York okay it's like that"
"09-12","5:16","so we need to write down the IP"
"09-12","5:18","information and of course there are"
"09-12","5:21","other information included in the"
"09-12","5:22","network header okay so this is a network"
"09-12","5:25","layer header"
"09-12","5:26","and now we can keep call this thing as a"
"09-12","5:29","packet so you can say in networking we"
"09-12","5:31","usually say oh packet packet but packet"
"09-12","5:33","is actually an hour clear thing if we"
"09-12","5:36","make this very formal okay"
"09-12","5:40","and then when it comes down to a layer"
"09-12","5:42","below"
"09-12","5:44","okay"
"09-12","5:45","this is a link layer we need to again"
"09-12","5:48","add some link layer header so it's like"
"09-12","5:51","we are adding another envelope outside"
"09-12","5:54","of the all the envelopes okay so it's a"
"09-12","5:57","like we are wrapping it again again"
"09-12","6:00","later on later okay it's like an onion"
"09-12","6:03","so now we have uh this is a thing called"
"09-12","6:06","frame so if the frame has a header"
"09-12","6:09","called link layer header okay"
"09-12","6:12","the frame will add some information like"
"09-12","6:15","the MAC address what is the source Mac"
"09-12","6:17","address what is the destination map"
"09-12","6:19","address"
"09-12","6:20","okay"
"09-12","6:21","uh so you may not know what is a MAC"
"09-12","6:24","address you don't need to know now I"
"09-12","6:27","think some of you may have already heard"
"09-12","6:29","this term before right so what is the"
"09-12","6:31","MAC address for device usually each"
"09-12","6:33","device has a unique Mac address"
"09-12","6:36","okay"
"09-12","6:38","um there are more information included"
"09-12","6:39","in the link layer header but Mac address"
"09-12","6:42","is the most important one or most"
"09-12","6:45","important piece okay"
"09-12","6:47","then eventually this Frame is sent to"
"09-12","6:50","the physical layer"
"09-12","6:52","and this becomes zeros and ones okay"
"09-12","6:56","send it out"
"09-12","6:59","so you can see how it travels"
"09-12","7:02","it's very interesting actually it comes"
"09-12","7:04","to the physical layer"
"09-12","7:06","and then goes down to the it goes up to"
"09-12","7:08","the link layer so why"
"09-12","7:10","because"
"09-12","7:13","these are these signals are zeros and"
"09-12","7:15","ones right of course it will firstly"
"09-12","7:17","come to the physical year"
"09-12","7:19","because they all arrived at the zeros"
"09-12","7:22","and ones right and then we pass it down"
"09-12","7:25","to up layer to link layer the link layer"
"09-12","7:27","will"
"09-12","7:29","um"
"09-12","7:30","sorry pass it up to nuclear the nuclear"
"09-12","7:33","will do some process here and then pass"
"09-12","7:35","it down again to the physical layer"
"09-12","7:38","becomes zero the ones when it arrives at"
"09-12","7:41","the router okay it's the same process it"
"09-12","7:45","arrives at zeros and ones okay then we"
"09-12","7:49","when it comes to the link layer when"
"09-12","7:51","this this uh"
"09-12","7:53","frame come to link layer okay and now"
"09-12","7:56","you can see what will happen is very"
"09-12","7:58","interesting the link layer the router"
"09-12","8:01","will will read the link layer header"
"09-12","8:03","you'll see oh this is to this Mac"
"09-12","8:05","address okay and then this header will"
"09-12","8:08","be removed"
"09-12","8:10","so then what is passed to the up layer"
"09-12","8:14","is actually we only have these ones left"
"09-12","8:17","each n h t and M"
"09-12","8:21","so you can see the link layer header is"
"09-12","8:23","removed and the network network layer"
"09-12","8:26","will read the network layer header like"
"09-12","8:29","oh what is the address okay"
"09-12","8:32","then this layer will this header will be"
"09-12","8:35","removed"
"09-12","8:37","okay so we have only h t and M left"
"09-12","8:41","um so"
"09-12","8:43","the router may add a new network layer"
"09-12","8:48","header when it comes down to the link"
"09-12","8:50","layer one the link layer will add a new"
"09-12","8:53","header link layer header okay so it"
"09-12","8:56","becomes zeros and ones again and then"
"09-12","8:59","pass it to the destination B"
"09-12","9:02","so again it becomes zeros and ones and"
"09-12","9:07","physical error at B B will convert this"
"09-12","9:11","and pass this up to nuclear link layer"
"09-12","9:14","will read the link layer header remove"
"09-12","9:17","this"
"09-12","9:19","okay positive to network layer it's like"
"09-12","9:22","open the envelope the"
"09-12","9:26","outside layer of envelope then it comes"
"09-12","9:30","down to the to comes up to the network"
"09-12","9:32","layer Network layer will read the header"
"09-12","9:35","Network layer header remove this header"
"09-12","9:39","okay and then pass what is inside to the"
"09-12","9:42","transport layer then transport delivery"
"09-12","9:43","the header and remove it finally the"
"09-12","9:46","message is passed to the application"
"09-12","9:48","here"
"09-12","9:48","so it's like the only again it's like"
"09-12","9:51","the onion we have Ionia we remove one"
"09-12","9:54","layer and another layer and then another"
"09-12","9:56","layer finally we see the the message in"
"09-12","9:59","the core okay oh it's like"
"09-12","10:02","um a letter that is wrapped with"
"09-12","10:04","multiple multi-layers of envelope so we"
"09-12","10:06","remove the envelope one by one okay"
"09-12","10:09","finally we see the method inside okay so"
"09-12","10:12","this is uh the entire process explains"
"09-12","10:15","how the message is sent and received and"
"09-12","10:19","uh in this entire process we see the"
"09-12","10:22","concept of encapsulation"
"09-12","10:24","okay"
"09-12","10:26","any questions so far hope you are not"
"09-12","10:29","all around"
"09-12","10:31","yeah I just wanted to clarify so when I"
"09-12","10:34","go to into the router it peel off the HL"
"09-12","10:37","and then it somehow get the HL again and"
"09-12","10:40","then when it comes to the destination"
"09-12","10:42","apiol of the HL one more time"
"09-12","10:46","uh good question you mean here yes we"
"09-12","10:49","need to get this get rid of this HL"
"09-12","10:51","right and then"
"09-12","10:54","so after we get rid of this HL and when"
"09-12","10:58","it comment comes down to comes to the"
"09-12","11:01","left part actually uh it's like it's"
"09-12","11:04","passing up to the network layer right"
"09-12","11:06","and then uh we need in the network layer"
"09-12","11:10","will do some process then it comes down"
"09-12","11:12","to link layer link layer will add a new"
"09-12","11:15","HL so although they are all called HL"
"09-12","11:18","but they are different hl's so yeah in"
"09-12","11:23","the HL the HL so for example a ringtone"
"09-12","11:25","in the MAC address is uh is a is a the"
"09-12","11:29","definition and Mac address is probably"
"09-12","11:30","this router okay but now the router will"
"09-12","11:34","change the destination Mac address into"
"09-12","11:36","uh the into B's Mac address"
"09-12","11:39","okay so that's why this HL is actually a"
"09-12","11:42","new HL"
"09-12","11:44","okay it's different from the one here on"
"09-12","11:48","the right on the right a right side of"
"09-12","11:50","the router"
"09-12","11:51","but when this message"
"09-12","11:54","when this entire thing is sent to here"
"09-12","11:56","to be okay so this each L is the same as"
"09-12","12:00","this one"
"09-12","12:02","and why does it have what's the"
"09-12","12:04","difference between those HL uh"
"09-12","12:08","this one this HL as I said is the same"
"09-12","12:11","as this HL"
"09-12","12:12","okay because uh it's simply this thing"
"09-12","12:16","this entire thing"
"09-12","12:17","is the past to be okay so it's still the"
"09-12","12:21","same thing that the HL is the same thing"
"09-12","12:23","and then this link layer will will read"
"09-12","12:27","this HL"
"09-12","12:28","and then remove this HL then pass what"
"09-12","12:32","is inside to the ARP layer"
"09-12","12:35","that doesn't make sense yeah yeah thank"
"09-12","12:37","you okay great"
"09-12","12:41","uh other questions"
"09-12","12:45","one question in the chat is is the link"
"09-12","12:48","layer created by the network layer"
"09-12","12:53","do you mean the link clear header or the"
"09-12","12:55","link layer yeah"
"09-12","12:57","um"
"09-12","12:59","I was just going to say does does it"
"09-12","13:02","strip the the link when it gets to a"
"09-12","13:04","router it strips the link"
"09-12","13:06","um layer off and then reads the network"
"09-12","13:09","layer to create a new link to the next"
"09-12","13:10","destination is that how it works"
"09-12","13:13","then puts the header back up top once it"
"09-12","13:15","has a new heading"
"09-12","13:18","um so here what what will happen is it"
"09-12","13:21","will read the link layer header let me"
"09-12","13:25","can I can I just"
"09-12","13:27","maybe remove all those drawings so we"
"09-12","13:32","can see it better"
"09-12","13:36","when it comes to the router here this is"
"09-12","13:41","Network layer so let me see"
"09-12","13:48","firstly event arrives it has all those"
"09-12","13:51","four layers headers link near header"
"09-12","13:53","Network layer header transport layer"
"09-12","13:55","header and the message itself okay then"
"09-12","13:59","the link layer header can only be"
"09-12","14:02","understood by the link layer"
"09-12","14:05","so you can think about this the the link"
"09-12","14:08","layer uh can understand the link layer"
"09-12","14:10","right so that's why the link layer"
"09-12","14:12","header can be understood by only the"
"09-12","14:14","link layer"
"09-12","14:15","it will it's it doesn't contain any"
"09-12","14:19","information that is useful for other"
"09-12","14:21","layers"
"09-12","14:22","okay so then the link layer will just"
"09-12","14:25","read the information from the link layer"
"09-12","14:27","header and after the information is used"
"09-12","14:30","it's not when link layer knows"
"09-12","14:33","what what is happening who is the uh"
"09-12","14:36","receiving Mac address the link layer can"
"09-12","14:38","simply remove this header and pass it to"
"09-12","14:41","our player okay"
"09-12","14:44","but when but you know you know because"
"09-12","14:47","of this this this entire thing"
"09-12","14:49","still has to be passed down to the lower"
"09-12","14:52","layer in order to transcend it out we"
"09-12","14:55","still need to become zeros and ones"
"09-12","14:57","that's why when it comes down to the"
"09-12","15:00","link layer again"
"09-12","15:02","then we have to add a new link layer"
"09-12","15:04","header"
"09-12","15:06","Okay add another Link at layer header so"
"09-12","15:09","some of you may ask why do we do that"
"09-12","15:12","okay because okay this uh as weeks and"
"09-12","15:16","explain more and learn more especially"
"09-12","15:19","when we talk about the link layer okay"
"09-12","15:21","then you will understand"
"09-12","15:22","sometimes we need to change the MAC"
"09-12","15:25","address in between"
"09-12","15:27","okay so because the link layer is DNA"
"09-12","15:31","with only the neighbors okay dealing"
"09-12","15:33","with only the neighbors for example if"
"09-12","15:35","I'm the uh the sender okay if let's see"
"09-12","15:39","a question is uh my direct neighbor okay"
"09-12","15:43","then I'll put the MAC address or"
"09-12","15:47","question"
"09-12","15:48","as the link layer as the destination Mac"
"09-12","15:52","address"
"09-12","15:53","okay as the destination Mac address"
"09-12","15:56","but actually eventually this letter is"
"09-12","15:59","going to let's say going to Michael"
"09-12","16:02","okay eventually this letter is going to"
"09-12","16:05","Michael then my the first Mac address I"
"09-12","16:08","use is probably Christian Mac address"
"09-12","16:10","then"
"09-12","16:12","when Christian received this Christian"
"09-12","16:14","needs to replace the MAC address to"
"09-12","16:18","his direct neighbor okay so probably his"
"09-12","16:21","direct neighbor is a Victor so then"
"09-12","16:24","he will change the link layer address"
"09-12","16:27","the MAC address into Victor's Mac"
"09-12","16:29","address"
"09-12","16:30","okay and then again so so you can see in"
"09-12","16:35","this process where we how to change the"
"09-12","16:37","Mac addresses sometimes we have to"
"09-12","16:40","change some of the information in"
"09-12","16:41","between that's why we actually we are"
"09-12","16:43","changing the link layer header"
"09-12","16:46","okay we are adding a new header and then"
"09-12","16:49","this entire thing is passed to here then"
"09-12","16:53","the definition will remove the headers"
"09-12","16:55","layer by layer"
"09-12","16:57","you can imagine okay you can imagine you"
"09-12","17:01","have a letter"
"09-12","17:02","okay the letter is wrapped"
"09-12","17:07","the letter is wrapped again and again"
"09-12","17:10","and again okay for different layers to"
"09-12","17:13","understand"
"09-12","17:14","okay it's wrapped with different"
"09-12","17:16","envelopes okay then when it comes to"
"09-12","17:20","specific layer"
"09-12","17:22","the layer can only read the envelope"
"09-12","17:25","information"
"09-12","17:26","for this specific layer"
"09-12","17:30","okay so for example the link layer"
"09-12","17:35","the link layer"
"09-12","17:37","can only read the envelope information"
"09-12","17:40","from here after it reads the information"
"09-12","17:44","then it doesn't need this layer anymore"
"09-12","17:46","it doesn't need this envelope anymore so"
"09-12","17:49","then this envelope is removed"
"09-12","17:52","the inside is passed to the up layer"
"09-12","17:55","okay"
"09-12","17:56","then of course if we want to send it out"
"09-12","18:00","okay"
"09-12","18:01","send this entire thing this entire"
"09-12","18:03","letter out again we have to add another"
"09-12","18:05","envelope nuclear envelope"
"09-12","18:08","okay so when it comes down comes to the"
"09-12","18:12","um destination then again we remove the"
"09-12","18:15","envelope layer by layer"
"09-12","18:18","okay finally we can see the inside it's"
"09-12","18:20","like that"
"09-12","18:22","um for now we didn't cover we didn't"
"09-12","18:25","mention anything about the routing we I"
"09-12","18:27","mean in this entire process there's no"
"09-12","18:30","routing kind of thing because we"
"09-12","18:34","um we are purely talking about what rock"
"09-12","18:36","there is only one way one route this is"
"09-12","18:40","purely going through this a to S to R"
"09-12","18:44","and then to B"
"09-12","18:46","okay we didn't talk talk about oh how"
"09-12","18:49","about we change to another different"
"09-12","18:51","route it's like we are talking about"
"09-12","18:54","only from Sacramento"
"09-12","18:57","to New York"
"09-12","19:00","okay we are going through probably let's"
"09-12","19:03","see Chicago"
"09-12","19:06","but we didn't mention a different route"
"09-12","19:10","that go through La we we we we"
"09-12","19:14","here we simplify the problem we say okay"
"09-12","19:17","let's see just let's just look at this"
"09-12","19:19","route what will happen it's like this"
"09-12","19:22","because we we have we do not have any"
"09-12","19:25","um"
"09-12","19:26","we do not have any more knowledge yet so"
"09-12","19:29","at the very beginning when we talk about"
"09-12","19:31","all these different layers how this will"
"09-12","19:33","work this is uh probably a little bit"
"09-12","19:35","overwhelming and very abstract okay"
"09-12","19:40","um but gradually gradually just keep"
"09-12","19:42","this in your mind this is how we work"
"09-12","19:44","how this latest kind of thing work okay"
"09-12","19:48","keep it in your mind and gradually when"
"09-12","19:50","we learn more about the each layer okay"
"09-12","19:53","then you will understand how the entire"
"09-12","19:56","thing works we are going to talk about"
"09-12","19:58","uh the now"
"09-14","0:01","each layer okay then you will understand how the entire thing works we are going"
"09-14","0:08","to talk about uh the network security okay security is actually uh now a very"
"09-14","0:14","important aspect in networking and we will not go deep into the security but"
"09-14","0:20","we will uh we will only introduce some of the basic concepts very common attack"
"09-14","0:26","types things like that if you want to know more about security"
"09-14","0:32","um you uh and we later in this class we will still uh when we introduce some of"
"09-14","0:37","the applications or some of the protocols we will still talk about"
"09-14","0:43","security if they are related but anyway in this class the major focus"
"09-14","0:49","is not security so if you are really interested in this topic then you should"
"09-14","0:55","take 154 the security class okay all right so let's see"
"09-14","1:04","so basically uh for network security we are talking about the attack and defense"
"09-14","1:10","most of the time okay um in the network security field we we"
"09-14","1:16","are really interested in how the bad guys uh can attack the computer networks how"
"09-14","1:24","can they achieve the attack the tax okay and then how we can defend the network"
"09-14","1:29","attacks against this uh the networks against the net attacks basically we"
"09-14","1:35","always have attackers and Defenders usually most of the Enterprise networks"
"09-14","1:40","have dedicated groups or teams security teams to"
"09-14","1:45","work uh against the attackers basically they will deploy some security sensors"
"09-14","1:51","some of the defending tools like firewalls detection tools so they they"
"09-14","1:59","can protect the network better okay so this is a what what will happen What"
"09-14","2:04","happens in the Enterprise Networks and then people also didn't also think about"
"09-14","2:09","how to design the architecture that are immune to a text this is actually I"
"09-14","2:15","would say um a topic that will be there forever okay"
"09-14","2:21","so it's really hard it's really hard to design an architecture a network"
"09-14","2:27","architecture that are immune to our text based on especially because we are building this network this internet"
"09-14","2:34","without Security in mind so you can think about it there are a lot of Legacy"
"09-14","2:39","issues right so we designed the network in this way without secreting in mind and now if you want to completely change"
"09-14","2:46","the architecture to make it immune to our taxes so I would say it's very very challenging it's very hard okay"
"09-14","2:53","um so originally people really don't think about security they just when we when we first saw"
"09-14","3:00","Vision the internet uh people just think this is a a group of mutually trusted"
"09-14","3:06","users attached to a transparent Network this is really if you you stand at this"
"09-14","3:12","point right now you will see oh okay this version is really innocent right it's really a naive but um"
"09-14","3:21","at that time when network was firstly designed people do things like that okay"
"09-14","3:26","until until some naughty high school students began to do something back to"
"09-14","3:32","the network and then people realize oh okay this kind of vacation actions can"
"09-14","3:38","really really um lead to some disasters in networking"
"09-14","3:43","okay so then the Internet Protocol designers are now playing the catch-up games"
"09-14","3:49","basically we want to improve this protocol in this way in that way to make"
"09-14","3:55","the networking more secure okay more secure but still as I said it's it's"
"09-14","4:00","very challenging okay that's why the cyber security right now is actually a"
"09-14","4:05","very Hot Topic in the research area okay very hot topics"
"09-14","4:10","um and if uh if you have some background in security when you are looking for a"
"09-14","4:16","job you definitely stand out from the others okay so um some of you may may ask that if we"
"09-14","4:25","consider security where should we consider security we learned the five layers right five Internet Protocol"
"09-14","4:32","stack layers um we have application near transport layer Network layer link layer physical"
"09-14","4:39","layer then where should we put security as I mentioned this is actually a"
"09-14","4:44","drawback or layer the layer kind of architecture right so security does not fit to one specific layer okay so"
"09-14","4:54","security must be considered in all different layers we need all layers from"
"09-14","4:59","application layer to the physical layer so this is something you have to keep in"
"09-14","5:04","mind foreign what is the goal of the bad guys"
"09-14","5:12","okay basically their goal is to put the malware into the hose here the horse"
"09-14","5:19","with me all the different Computing devices like computers iPads tablets right so mobile phones all"
"09-14","5:28","those kind of things so put malware into the host via internet"
"09-14","5:33","okay this is a this is basically the goal of the attackers okay so the"
"09-14","5:41","malware can actually get into house in different ways for example they can get into the house in virus"
"09-14","5:48","or worn so what what are those virus is basically no matter it's a virus or one"
"09-14","5:56","we all know this is just a program right so virus and worm are just a piece of"
"09-14","6:01","code okay but they have different they have difference okay the virus"
"09-14","6:08","um basically can do self-replicating infection by receiving and executing the object okay so what"
"09-14","6:16","does this mean this means usually for example when you see a virus when you um"
"09-14","6:22","usually but this virus I really hidden in some kind of software right in"
"09-14","6:28","some kind of software or other files so it is usually"
"09-14","6:35","hidden and when I say hey I mean you cannot tell this is a virus by look just"
"09-14","6:41","looking at this look at this file okay so for example sometimes you may receive an email and the email saying hey uh"
"09-14","6:50","please click on that attachment I have some important files for you things like"
"09-14","6:55","that and once you click on that then this virus this is making this"
"09-14","7:01","attachment may contain the virus and then these virus may start the self-replicating process okay and you"
"09-14","7:09","can see in this process in this process other person or other people's actions"
"09-14","7:17","are very important okay if you do not click on this button"
"09-14","7:22","if you do need do not click on this attachment then wires can do nothing but if you click on this attachment then"
"09-14","7:29","the virus can start the self-replicity so that means the user or the internet"
"09-14","7:35","user innocent user's interaction is actually very important for the"
"09-14","7:41","self-replicating a virus okay but for warm warm is different okay warm"
"09-14","7:49","can do self-replicating infection by passively receiving the object that gets"
"09-14","7:55","itself executed in this process we do not need any actions from the users we"
"09-14","8:02","do not need any action from the innocent healer that's something you need to keep in mind okay"
"09-14","8:08","there are actually a lot of different types of worms some are very famous I"
"09-14","8:14","remember when I was still in China some um there there was one worm I cannot"
"09-14","8:20","remember them but I I deeply remember the how the computer behave after it is"
"09-14","8:28","infected so it's very interesting when the computer was infected then"
"09-14","8:33","everything is gone and the computer just has just display uh"
"09-14","8:40","a panda just play a panda there um so"
"09-14","8:46","um I can't describe this very accurately but uh panda is doing something there on"
"09-14","8:52","the on the computer so nothing else is displayed on the computer and it doesn't react to any of the actions from the"
"09-14","9:00","users um for this kind of warm so it it's only"
"09-14","9:05","uses it only uses uh it basically it will"
"09-14","9:11","only take advantage of the vulnerabilities on the computer okay it"
"09-14","9:17","doesn't need any actions from uh from the from the user okay so that's the"
"09-14","9:23","difference between warm and virus I may ask you the difference in the test"
"09-14","9:29","okay there is another type of malware called spyware spyware is actually very"
"09-14","9:35","useful and very um obviously very scary okay so spyware"
"09-14","9:42","can record the case jokes the websites visited um and basically all the actions that"
"09-14","9:51","you have already taken on the machine and then upload those information to some collection site so you think about"
"09-14","9:57","this if you type in a website like a bank a bank like chase.com okay and then"
"09-14","10:06","you begin to type in some username and password then this"
"09-14","10:12","kind of spiral is able to remember what website you have visited and what"
"09-14","10:18","letters you have typed into so then of course we can know the username and"
"09-14","10:24","password right so that is a harmful to the users okay"
"09-14","10:30","um so that is another type so some of you may ask what can they do"
"09-14","10:37","what can the attackers do if they get the house infected no matter using"
"09-14","10:44","Wireless or warm so what can they do so they can do a lot of things if they"
"09-14","10:52","compromise a machine okay you think about this one thing is as I said"
"09-14","10:57","probably they can install some spyware to monitor what you have already done"
"09-14","11:03","okay so they can steal your credentials that's one thing another thing is they"
"09-14","11:09","can control your machine right so actually in fact your machine they can"
"09-14","11:16","um so they can work as like administrator they they may say if so"
"09-14","11:22","for example if in if your motion is a Linux system then they can type in some commands Okay they can type in some"
"09-14","11:29","commands um then ask the machine to execute okay so for example they can send the very"
"09-14","11:37","important files back to the collection site back to the attackers or especially"
"09-14","11:44","if this machine is a very important machine like if this she is the"
"09-14","11:49","workstation used by a CEO of a company right so then this CEO's machine may"
"09-14","11:56","have a lot of uh important files like Financial files or other type of files"
"09-14","12:03","then attackers are able to to collect those information to uh to have some"
"09-14","12:11","Financial gains those kind of things right uh and we can they can also do other things okay for example you may"
"09-14","12:18","say oh my machine does not have this kind of a very important"
"09-14","12:23","um in files or information so I don't need to care about this you still need to care about this"
"09-14","12:29","because um these attackers May May control your machine and use your"
"09-14","12:36","machine to do something okay so for example even they can use your CPUs your"
"09-14","12:43","Computing resources okay to do something back or they can control your machine to"
"09-14","12:49","get your machine enrolled in the botnet so what is a botnet bottleneck means a"
"09-14","12:54","net worth of bots so a network of sleeves basically your machine is like a"
"09-14","13:00","sleeve or a bot that can be used for a lot of things like spam like Adidas"
"09-14","13:06","attacks okay so for example sending out spam emails or conducting DDOS attacks"
"09-14","13:13","so probably you do not understand what is DDOS we are going to introduce this in this slide so before I introduce DDOS"
"09-14","13:21","details sorry details means distributed foreign"
"09-14","13:31","distributive denial service that is DDOS okay before I introduce the distributed"
"09-14","13:39","denial Services let's first we talk about the denial service okay only does"
"09-14","13:45","so what is the noun service attack uh basically the now service means that"
"09-14","13:50","attackers make the resources resources here with me the server the Computing"
"09-14","13:56","resources the bandwidth making these resources and available to"
"09-14","14:02","legitimate traffic by by overwhelming resource with Focus traffic"
"09-14","14:08","so what does this mean this means so for example this is a server right so"
"09-14","14:15","this target here is a server when we see a server we mean the server is serving a"
"09-14","14:22","number of clients okay so for example you think about the Google web server so it is serving the"
"09-14","14:30","clients all over the world or you think about the sac State's web server it is serving all the Sac State"
"09-14","14:38","faculty and staff and students right so those servers are serving the clients"
"09-14","14:46","okay and then we want to if this is serving the clients we want to make sure the service is available to everybody"
"09-14","14:54","okay it's available to everybody then but one day if the server the the"
"09-14","15:00","service cannot be available to someone then this is problematic okay for"
"09-14","15:05","example if you one day you want to visit the website for Sac State you cannot you"
"09-14","15:10","cannot visit it then you you will feel bad right or if one day you cannot use Google then you will feel frustrated so"
"09-14","15:18","that's that's why we want to make the service available to everybody so what's the the attacker will do in"
"09-14","15:25","the denial service attack is firstly it will select a Target"
"09-14","15:31","okay then the attackers will break into the house"
"09-14","15:37","around the network okay so for example you can say those ones are all"
"09-14","15:44","compromised by the attackers now these computers becomes"
"09-14","15:50","the Bots It all becomes the sleeves so they will"
"09-14","15:55","basically follow all the commands by the master the master here is uh is a machine"
"09-14","16:02","controlled by the attacker okay so after that after that then the"
"09-14","16:10","attacker will send the package to the target from the compromise house so you"
"09-14","16:16","can say there are so many computers controlled by the attacker they can send"
"09-14","16:23","packets to the Target at the same time okay simultaneously can we can do this"
"09-14","16:28","at the same time then in this case the server does not know the server pay"
"09-14","16:35","attention the server does not know that this request this packets are from"
"09-14","16:41","malicious machines the server will just treat them as legitimate users innocent"
"09-14","16:47","users okay then the server will try to serve all these machines or to to get"
"09-14","16:56","respect to respond to all those requests okay"
"09-14","17:02","then in this case as you can see because the server is too busy with those"
"09-14","17:08","malicious requests how what if if there is one innocent user who also want to"
"09-14","17:16","get service from the server could the server still reply back the server"
"09-14","17:22","cannot okay the server does not have the capacity to reply back to the client"
"09-14","17:31","okay so that's that's that means the server is actually denying denying to"
"09-14","17:39","serve the client that's why we call this as denial or service attack"
"09-14","17:44","does this make sense so it's like for example if I'm uh I'm"
"09-14","17:50","having office hours okay I have office hours to all the students in our class"
"09-14","17:56","if one day okay if one day let's say we have some bad guy let's see Alex is a"
"09-14","18:03","is the bad guy who controlled most of our students in"
"09-14","18:09","this class Alex yes sorry for using you as an"
"09-14","18:14","example okay um so let's say um"
"09-14","18:24","um so let's say Alex Now controls most of the students in our class and he he"
"09-14","18:30","sent uh this this bad students to my office hours and each student will I"
"09-14","18:38","mean they all stay there for very very long time so then I'm fully occupied by"
"09-14","18:43","these bad students right then in this case if we have a good student let's see"
"09-14","18:50","uh Aaron comes in Ira is a good student so he wants to see me to get help so can"
"09-14","18:57","I still help Aaron I cannot right so this is the denial service to"
"09-14","19:04","Aaron and all the other students actually okay"
"09-14","19:11","um so that's what we call as denial service attack so actually what I I'm describing here"
"09-14","19:19","is a you can you can view it as a distributed uh denial service because"
"09-14","19:25","you can see all those requests are distributed into different machines"
"09-14","19:33","okay into different machines this is already distributed in our service attack so some of you may think that"
"09-14","19:39","what is the now service attack in our service attack is uh basically what we"
"09-14","19:45","mean is a for example if we have Alex again as the bad guy so Alex come to my"
"09-14","19:51","office hour and ask me uh millions of questions okay"
"09-14","19:57","so then I'm too busy with Alex I have to answer all his questions then in this"
"09-14","20:04","case in this case I cannot serve anybody else right so so basically the attack"
"09-14","20:09","the attack is from Alex itself only one machine is sending a lot of requests"
"09-14","20:16","okay that is the now service attack but for denial of service attack I would say it's it's kind of easy to block to to"
"09-14","20:23","prevent or to uh to address this issue for example if I know Alex is is a bad"
"09-14","20:30","guy then I can simply say oh I recognize you you are you are the bad guy I I won't let you come"
"09-14","20:37","to my office hour okay it's very easy to plug"
"09-14","20:42","um similarly if we say one machine if we see one machine is making a lot more requests to the server then we can"
"09-14","20:50","simply block that machine because we can easily we can easily tell the IP address"
"09-14","20:55","of that machine okay we can just block the track traffic from this machine so it's very easy"
"09-14","21:01","but for distribution uh denial Service as you can see because the traffic is"
"09-14","21:06","coming from all different users okay although they are all malicious users"
"09-14","21:12","but they are coming from all different IP addresses How can I block them we cannot because it's very"
"09-14","21:19","hard to tell which ones are innocent which ones are not innocent okay which"
"09-14","21:24","ones are malicious it's very hard to tell that's why distributed denial service attack is actually much harder"
"09-14","21:31","to prevent than denial service attack and"
"09-14","21:36","in the test I may ask you what is the denial service attack okay or what is a distributed now"
"09-14","21:43","service attack so you should know um the definition here okay"
"09-14","21:51","the next question the next topic is about packet sniffing so what is packing"
"09-14","21:56","sniffy Pakistani means if we have two computers talking to each other"
"09-14","22:03","okay and these two computers they need to use some kind of uh media right or"
"09-14","22:09","sometimes men or many times they have to use like broadcast media like uh the"
"09-14","22:14","shared Ethernet or the wireless network okay for example when we use Wi-Fi when"
"09-14","22:20","a is sending some information to basically everybody in this network can"
"09-14","22:28","receive the package from a so it's called broadcasting media okay then in"
"09-14","22:34","this case in this case if we have some bad guy here like C"
"09-14","22:40","which can record all the packets passing by"
"09-14","22:46","okay that is a uh that that will generate some negative impacts so what"
"09-14","22:53","does this mean you can think about this the bad guy C if it can listen to all"
"09-14","23:00","the package then it is able to capture all the information inside the package"
"09-14","23:05","right for example here if B is sending a package to a The Source IP address is B"
"09-14","23:13","destination IP address is a and the payload payload contains some input important"
"09-14","23:21","information usually okay for example the payload may include the password okay so some of you may think"
"09-14","23:28","how could the password be included right or"
"09-14","23:34","are the password encrypted let me tell you the truth"
"09-14","23:39","many times for many applications actually the passwords are passed or are"
"09-14","23:47","sent out in plain text you cannot imagine this many of the"
"09-14","23:53","times when you look at a package you can easily find out the passwords okay"
"09-14","23:59","that's very important then if C is able to find out the"
"09-14","24:04","password then C can do a lot of things right if a is the server like let's see"
"09-14","24:11","a a bank or some other website then C can easily use the password"
"09-14","24:16","of B to sign in this webpage to basically do anything she wants"
"09-14","24:24","okay so that's why Tech sniffing is actually very important"
"09-14","24:30","um and as I said not all the applications encrypt the data no many"
"09-14","24:37","many of the applications simply did not encrypt the data okay that's very important that's actually why in one of"
"09-14","24:45","my 153 plus some students did a course project"
"09-14","24:51","to use the Wi-Fi okay they just go to Starbucks or those kind of public Wi-Fi"
"09-14","24:57","to set up a fake Wi-Fi okay uh this week I Wi-Fi is free to"
"09-14","25:06","everybody so if you connect to that okay if you connect to that then that"
"09-14","25:12","um Wi-Fi will basically collect all the payloads all the pack is going through"
"09-14","25:17","then in this case they are able to look into the confidential information"
"09-14","25:23","contained in this uh packets so that's a that's my very interesting thing so some"
"09-14","25:30","of you may think oh the proximity is mainly used for"
"09-14","25:35","um malicious uh intent I would say no sometimes the the specs sniffing can"
"09-14","25:42","also be used for some good uses okay so or at least it's neutral okay it can"
"09-14","25:49","be for gold or it can be for bad okay it's packaged sniffing legal it depends"
"09-14","25:57","okay depends so if you are using let's so what I'm going to introduce uh right"
"09-14","26:03","now is actually the Wireshark software and you are actually going to use software shock to do a lab"
"09-14","26:10","um in our class the Wireshark software is a packet sniffer okay it's a package"
"09-14","26:18","name for it is it is uh it's installed on your machine okay you can install it"
"09-14","26:23","on your machine or some other people's motion if they allow you to do so then"
"09-14","26:29","if you enable capturing the packets all the pack is going through"
"09-14","26:36","all the pack is coming to a machine or going out your from your machine will be"
"09-14","26:41","captured by Workshop okay now you are actually sniffing uh to pack sniffing on"
"09-14","26:47","your own machine so obviously this is legal okay this is of course legal but sometimes if you want to do packing"
"09-14","26:54","sniffing on some other machines um especially for those big companies uh"
"09-14","27:01","that may not be legal okay that's the difference and later you are going to learn more"
"09-14","27:08","about my shock okay so basically why in my shock you are able to capture uh most of the all"
"09-14","27:16","the packets okay and then you can see especially for example if you connect to"
"09-14","27:22","a website uh or if you send out an email so all the traffic are captured and you"
"09-14","27:28","are able to see uh what is the IP address the source IP address doesn't IP address what is the phone number used so"
"09-14","27:36","what are the payloads um and you can even see the protocols used at each layer and later as I said"
"09-14","27:43","in the Wireshark lab you are going to learn more about this tool okay so the last one we are going to"
"09-14","27:50","introduce in our class is uh IPS spoofing so what does this mean IP spoofing"
"09-14","27:57","basically means send in packet with Force Source address"
"09-14","28:04","okay so this for example if a and b again are"
"09-14","28:10","talking to each other okay now b c is the bad guy"
"09-14","28:16","C can pretend to be a b okay so you can"
"09-14","28:22","pretend to be B and then send a package to a okay here you can see it is saying"
"09-14","28:29","the source I Source address is B the destination address is a and it's sending some payload then what a reply"
"09-14","28:36","when a reply a will directly reply to the source okay what our source is put"
"09-14","28:42","there it will reply to this source so a we are simply reply to"
"09-14","28:48","see directly okay okay to say directly because say is now"
"09-14","28:56","using pretending to BB using this IP address right so then any of your think"
"09-14","29:01","C is uh the um say is the sauce Source a will reply"
"09-14","29:08","back to C okay so then all the basically C is able to capture the package to be"
"09-14","29:15","um or we can say hijack the package to be okay so most of the time most of the"
"09-14","29:23","time you may see why do we do this why do why does c do this why does c do the"
"09-14","29:28","my piece moving is like pretending to be someone else"
"09-14","29:34","okay so basically if C pretends to be B then C can do a lot of things in the"
"09-14","29:40","name of B okay many many times and many times IPS"
"09-14","29:45","buffing can be used together with packets packet sniffing how can we do"
"09-14","29:51","that so if you look at this slide again say can basically if a is talking to B"
"09-14","29:58","Okay C can basically listen to their conversation and then find then capture"
"09-14","30:04","these packets okay capture this package and see we all know what is the payload Etc"
"09-14","30:12","so especially for example if you see if a is asking for some information from B"
"09-14","30:19","to authenticate B okay it's like for example what is your"
"09-14","30:24","mother's maiden name let's see although in networking uh this usually this is"
"09-14","30:30","another question right but we I think I want to make make your uh clear about how this works so let's just use this"
"09-14","30:37","example if a is asking maybe what is the middle uh the your mother's maiden name"
"09-14","30:43","okay only B knows the answer C does not know right but what a c can do is see"
"09-14","30:51","listening to their conversation and then see basically get this package"
"09-14","30:58","in this package B is telling a what is the middle name so let's say the middle"
"09-14","31:03","name is X okay then now C note oh okay B's mother"
"09-14","31:10","has a maiden name of ads then C can use this"
"09-14","31:17","X okay to answer the question of a"
"09-14","31:22","a question from a if C is doing this much faster than b"
"09-14","31:28","okay then a will basically accept the first the first packet"
"09-14","31:33","coming to a and then of course here see we also pretend to be"
"09-14","31:39","B okay then Aerials think if you think C is B okay maybe I'll think oh I'm still"
"09-14","31:47","talking to B and then a will reply to C and C oh okay you are authenticated then"
"09-14","31:53","now what do you want to do okay then say Oh say like okay let me withdraw 1000"
"09-14","31:58","bucks okay then C can withdraw money from uh B's account"
"09-14","32:03","so that is what will happen um so what I'm talking about now is actually called The Man in the middle"
"09-14","32:10","attack"
"09-14","32:17","okay MIM nine in the middle attack basically"
"09-14","32:22","basically C is the mat in the middle C is able to do a lot of bad things by"
"09-14","32:31","firstly Listening to A and B's conversation and then pretending to be B"
"09-14","32:37","uh to get authenticated and then talk today okay so the my middle mind the middle"
"09-14","32:44","attack is a very very common in security and it's actually very challenging uh"
"09-14","32:51","type of attack that that can happen in very in very different scenarios so a"
"09-14","32:59","lot of research are working on how to prevent this kind of attacks okay"
"09-14","33:05","uh that's all about the security Parts I think we are done with chapter one"
"09-16","0:05","today we are going to discuss the application layer application layer is"
"09-16","0:10","the very first layer top the top layer that we will study for this entire class"
"09-16","0:16","and you are probably worth minimum in some of the terms in this layer so it's"
"09-16","0:22","actually a good thing to start with um personally this is like the structure for this entire chapter so you can see"
"09-16","0:30","2.1 is about principles and 2.2 we are going to introduce the web application"
"09-16","0:36","HTTP service and let me talk about email DNS some of the P2P applications and we"
"09-16","0:44","will discuss the video streaming okay the last portion is the sockey"
"09-16","0:49","programming assignment project programming okay so I will move this"
"09-16","0:55","section uh to forward so we can start"
"09-16","1:01","the soccer program assignment as soon as possible okay all right"
"09-16","1:07","okay so what already what are we going to accomplish in this chapter"
"09-16","1:13","basically we are talking about some of the some of the concepts regarding application layer okay I will get you"
"09-16","1:20","familiar with some of the protocols like HTTP FTP SMTP DS okay for SFTP we will probably"
"09-16","1:29","skip FTP will skip okay but for the other protocols we will be we will"
"09-16","1:36","definitely discuss and another important thing we are going to discuss is about the socket okay this is a very important"
"09-16","1:44","Concept in application layer and you will see this concept again and again"
"09-16","1:50","actually all right so let's start firstly let's talk about some of the"
"09-16","1:56","applications Network applications I'm sure you are very familiar with some of"
"09-16","2:02","them right email web test messaging for those who are you you probably use it"
"09-16","2:07","every day and remote login P2P file sharing uh the games the videos all"
"09-16","2:15","those kind of things they belong to the applications right so when you when you"
"09-16","2:20","want to use something use some service but basically you need to firstly install an application on your machine"
"09-16","2:28","okay on your device it can be a computer or a mobile device right so these are"
"09-16","2:34","the network applications then when you think about the application if for example if you are"
"09-16","2:42","starting to create a new network application"
"09-16","2:48","okay so of course you may need to run some programs as the end systems"
"09-16","2:53","those programs need to communicate over the network for example you think about"
"09-16","2:59","this if you are writing a messaging let's say application Messenger"
"09-16","3:05","application right I'll call the two computers need to communicate with each other over the network and then each"
"09-16","3:13","application each computer each end system needs to need to install this"
"09-16","3:19","application okay so those applications are installed on and systems and then they communicate"
"09-16","3:25","now you can also think about the web browser communicate with the uh the"
"09-16","3:31","other machine okay the other machines so then the web browser here is uh like"
"09-16","3:37","an application then as we said if you want to write a network application then"
"09-16","3:44","you need to write a program for that right right program for that application"
"09-16","3:49","like you need to write a program for this web server sorry for this uh web"
"09-16","3:55","browser okay sorry I think I I Mark something wrong I should say"
"09-16","4:01","browser okay you need to write a browser application of course if this browser is"
"09-16","4:09","communicating with web server then you need to also write the web server"
"09-16","4:14","software okay probably right now I mean the idea of server is still a bit"
"09-16","4:20","abstract in your mind that's totally fine just imagine it's a machine okay"
"09-16","4:26","imagine it as a machine um now again for the messaging"
"09-16","4:31","application as I said if you have two devices communicating with each other"
"09-16","4:37","they are sending messages to each other then of course you need to write the program for each messaging application"
"09-16","4:43","okay so those are the things you need to do as the developer"
"09-16","4:50","but you need to think about this when you write the program for the"
"09-16","4:55","software or for the application do you need to write the program or the"
"09-16","5:02","code for the network core devices that means do you need to consider"
"09-16","5:08","about the routers how the routers work uh how do you set up the routers how do"
"09-16","5:15","you uh write algorithms or protocols for the browsers do we need to do that"
"09-16","5:22","you don't need to right you don't need to so as a developer you never worry"
"09-16","5:28","about how the network code will work how will those vouchers work right you just care"
"09-16","5:36","about your applications you never worry about those then why why don't you need"
"09-16","5:42","to think about this as we mentioned before actually the"
"09-16","5:48","internet is like providing some kind of service right if you take a service view the internet is actually providing you"
"09-16","5:56","some service so basically all those Network core devices have already had their own"
"09-16","6:03","programs Okay so what you need to do as a developer is"
"09-16","6:09","you only need to write your own application and then use some API to to"
"09-16","6:18","to use the services provided by those Network core devices here what I mean"
"09-16","6:24","our code devices are the routers right you need to you need to get services from those routers from the"
"09-16","6:31","infrastructure but you don't need to do it on your own okay it's like"
"09-16","6:37","when you try to do a business for example okay you may use the Postal"
"09-16","6:42","Service then you may drop a package to the or drop the packages to the post office"
"09-16","6:50","but you never need to deploy the entire network for postal service"
"09-16","6:56","right so you are using the service from them but you don't need to worry about"
"09-16","7:02","how they are implemented okay it's the same thing okay it's the same thing so this is"
"09-16","7:09","about how to create a network application and what you need to worry about basically"
"09-16","7:15","okay so now you can see uh on the figures we see on the devices"
"09-16","7:22","on devices or on the end systems they all have five layers"
"09-16","7:28","okay they all have five layers application Layer Two physically and then you can see the communication"
"09-16","7:36","is basically happening between application layer to application layer but later we will know okay the"
"09-16","7:43","communication is actually supported by the layers below okay by all the layers"
"09-16","7:51","below okay so question so far"
"09-16","8:00","okay then the next thing we are going to discuss is the application architectures"
"09-16","8:07","okay there are generally two types of architectures one is client server model"
"09-16","8:13","the other one is peer-to-peer model or we can call it P2P model"
"09-16","8:19","so what are the differences between them probably you are already very familiar"
"09-16","8:25","with the names right client serum model P2P model but you never know the difference between them let's look at"
"09-16","8:31","each one firstly for client server model for client server model if we view these"
"09-16","8:40","are the servers okay the servers will provide services"
"09-16","8:48","and again as I said servers are just machines okay no matter how big they are"
"09-16","8:54","they may be back they may be small they may be like just your PC okay but"
"09-16","9:01","they are providing services to others okay and there are some characteristics"
"09-16","9:08","for servers for example firstly they are always on"
"09-16","9:15","okay the servers usually cannot go down if the service go down you can imagine"
"09-16","9:22","especially for those big companies they may suffer from a lot of financial loss"
"09-16","9:28","they cannot afford the server was going down okay so basically a huge thing if we see a"
"09-16","9:34","servers going uh server going down um that's why many times actually the servers they have backup service if one"
"09-16","9:41","server is down then the other servers can survive the backup uh so that's why it's very important to make sure we have"
"09-16","9:50","always on servers okay always on cost then uh the second thing is"
"09-16","9:58","the servers always have permanent IP address"
"09-16","10:03","what does this mean this means the IP addresses for servers"
"09-16","10:09","can never be changed okay they are also the same you may ask why"
"09-16","10:16","the reason is because the clients the clients usually will"
"09-16","10:21","need to contact the servers right so if the IP address of the servers are"
"09-16","10:27","changing then how could those clients know what is the most up-to-date IP address"
"09-16","10:34","right it's very hard for the clients to know so that's why the servers always"
"09-16","10:39","maintain the same IP address so for example for Google Okay google.com this uh when you type in"
"09-16","10:47","google.com actually later you will learn this URL google.com will be all this"
"09-16","10:53","domain name or this server name will be translated into an IP address e uh"
"09-16","11:00","through the DN service okay uh so basically this IP address is"
"09-16","11:07","always there okay it's always there that's the second thing the third thing"
"09-16","11:13","is usually the servers will have data centers for scaling okay of course as I said if you are"
"09-16","11:21","simply implementing a server or your own use okay or deploy a server"
"09-16","11:27","for very small company or very small Network to serve"
"09-16","11:32","only a few clients then you probably don't need a data center"
"09-16","11:38","probably just your um PC is good enough okay"
"09-16","11:44","but if you have a lot of clients okay if your company is Skilling then you have"
"09-16","11:51","to think about this Skilling okay you have to think about how to accommodate the large number of"
"09-16","11:59","clients that's why we really need the data centers for scaling okay so those"
"09-16","12:05","are the third characteristics for the servers"
"09-16","12:10","then for the clients okay for the clients they also have some"
"09-16","12:15","characteristics for example the clients need to communicate with the server"
"09-16","12:21","okay they usually need to communicate with the server they do not communicate"
"09-16","12:27","directly with each other okay so that means that means"
"09-16","12:34","for example if you are running a web browser okay the web browser is a client"
"09-16","12:40","it's a client program so here I hope you can I want to firstly clarify my basic"
"09-16","12:47","client server have usually refers to the machine we usually refer to the machine but"
"09-16","12:53","that's not accurate because on your machine for example you can think about this on your machine you may run a"
"09-16","12:59","number of applications you may have web application you may have email you may have video gaming right you have all"
"09-16","13:05","those applications then in this case if we want to be more"
"09-16","13:10","accurate then the client means client program"
"09-16","13:16","okay so for example when we see web server okay then web server is a server now who"
"09-16","13:23","is the client the client can be a machine if we refer to this generally but more accurately we should see the"
"09-16","13:31","client is uh the web browser it's the Firefox this is the Chrome okay so it's"
"09-16","13:37","like that it's the web browser okay so here when I say the clients cannot"
"09-16","13:44","communicate directly with each other we mean yoga browser cannot communicate"
"09-16","13:52","with another web browser we cannot okay they can only communicate"
"09-16","13:58","with the server that's the client okay of course the clients may be"
"09-16","14:03","intermittently connected they may be up they may be down okay we do not have any requirements on"
"09-16","14:10","clients it's totally fine for clients to be off okay"
"09-16","14:15","the clients may also have Dynamic IP addresses it's totally fine for the client to"
"09-16","14:23","to um to change the IP address okay but we do not"
"09-16","14:29","usually we do not change the IP address for Server because server server is the one to be contacted okay everybody"
"09-16","14:36","should know the IEP address for the server all right so that is the client server"
"09-16","14:43","model any questions"
"09-16","14:50","okay so the next architecture is the P2P architecture"
"09-16","14:56","in P2P art architecture we do not have any servers no servers no always answers"
"09-16","15:03","okay we only have some n systems"
"09-16","15:10","okay those end systems are the peers they are exactly the same I mean when I"
"09-16","15:16","say the same I mean they are treated at the same okay of course they can have different settings"
"09-16","15:22","then we can have those peers communicate with each other directly"
"09-16","15:29","okay then the peers the peers usually will need to request a service from other"
"09-16","15:35","peers okay and also at the same time the peers can provide a service in return to"
"09-16","15:42","other peers okay so it's like if you think about the"
"09-16","15:47","uh our class okay if you think about our class then client server model is like"
"09-16","15:53","I'm the server you are the client I'm serving you okay then P2P model is like you are all"
"09-16","16:02","learning from each other you do not need any instructors okay you are all learning from each"
"09-16","16:09","other you are all um help each other so you can request service from each other and you can also"
"09-16","16:15","provide service to each other okay then you if you think about the"
"09-16","16:20","scalability that's very interesting okay if you think about scalability actually"
"09-16","16:26","the P2P network is very self-scalable why because when we have new periods"
"09-16","16:35","joining the network the new peers of course they will need to get service"
"09-16","16:42","from others right but at the same time they can also provide service to others"
"09-16","16:48","that means the new peer actually bring new service capacity"
"09-16","16:54","okay as well as the new service demands of course"
"09-16","16:59","so again if you use our class as the example if I'm the server you are the clients"
"09-16","17:06","then I can only handle this many students okay if I have like 200"
"09-16","17:11","students of course I cannot handle all of them right it's too big for me to manage"
"09-16","17:18","then we have a scalability issue but if you are doing P2P network if you are"
"09-16","17:24","learning from each other then basically you do not need uh you do"
"09-16","17:29","not need much help from the instructions right so you can you your Learning"
"09-16","17:35","Network I would say is a self-scalable okay"
"09-16","17:41","um so the peers are intermittently connected and they also change the IP addresses so you think about this"
"09-16","17:48","because there is no always on server the peers can always change the IP address"
"09-16","17:54","they may get connected or get disconnected then the amendment is actually very complex okay this is a one"
"09-16","18:03","of the drawbacks for PHP Network compared to the client server model"
"09-16","18:10","all right so question so far"
"09-16","18:23","foreign drawbacks with P2P regarding security"
"09-16","18:32","this is a a very general question regarding security I would I cannot see"
"09-16","18:39","there are some specific drawbacks that are related to only P2P"
"09-16","18:45","okay so the the major difference between P2P and client server model is like the"
"09-16","18:51","management product scalability those kind of things but in regards to security"
"09-16","18:57","or I would say most of the problems most of the problems are the same are the"
"09-16","19:04","same for both financial model and the PPP model okay but of course there is one thing you need to pay attention when"
"09-16","19:10","we talk about security okay for client server model it's very easy to conduct"
"09-16","19:16","detox attack do you remember what we discussed in last slides uh sorry last chapter regarding DDOS attack for DDOS"
"09-16","19:24","attack we said so for example uh there are a number of machines you one who wants to"
"09-16","19:32","get requests from the host right here the host we mean the"
"09-16","19:37","server then if this server gets a lot of fake requests from the malicious"
"09-16","19:45","machines Then This Server can be easily taken down okay this server cannot"
"09-16","19:52","provide regular service to the other legitimation machines or the legitimate clients okay so then in this case I"
"09-16","19:59","would say cancel model is a very vulnerable but for P2P model we do not"
"09-16","20:04","have that issue okay that's one example but as I said for most of the other"
"09-16","20:10","aspects I would say they are kind of similar in terms of security for example"
"09-16","20:15","think about the communication between machines the encryption decryption uh"
"09-16","20:22","the package significant the eyepiece spoofing all those kind of things they are similar okay but the client server"
"09-16","20:30","model is sometimes more vulnerable because the server is always there the"
"09-16","20:36","IP address is not changing okay uh and the attackers can easily scan the"
"09-16","20:43","network and know which ports are opening then uh"
"09-16","20:48","and also the server may have some vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited so those are the things you"
"09-16","20:55","may need to consider of course DDOS is another thing you need to consider okay"
"09-16","21:01","another question is why would anyone go for P2P our server this is a great"
"09-16","21:07","question why would anyone go for P2P 2p actually as we as we see here P2P"
"09-16","21:15","have has its own benefits for example scalability scalability is really good"
"09-16","21:22","for PHP okay um and if I I'm not sure if you have"
"09-16","21:27","used some of the tools before for example B torrent okay"
"09-16","21:33","it's one of the PVP application yes you in B torrent basically sometimes"
"09-16","21:39","you can download the file very fast okay you don't need to wait for the server to"
"09-16","21:45","respond because you can get service from so many different other peers okay so"
"09-16","21:50","that is uh I would say one of the benefits to use big P2P foreign"
"09-16","21:57","there is another question in the last slide is up here just any device"
"09-16","22:03","yes okay the appear here is uh just a device any device okay and it can be a a"
"09-16","22:12","PC it can be like a laptop it can be a tablet or mobile from any device as long"
"09-16","22:20","as they are connected to the network then they become appear okay and the later we are going to spend"
"09-16","22:26","more time discussing the PHP Network Christian mentioned tolerance P2P right"
"09-16","22:33","yeah be torrent and Torrence P2P is the one great application for P2P"
"09-16","22:39","all right so those are awkward questions any other questions"
"09-16","22:50","okay so then we will continue the next thing I want to discuss is"
"09-16","22:57","actually the process communicating when we say a machine is talking to"
"09-16","23:03","another machine in your mind in your mind okay"
"09-16","23:08","foreign probably now you are thinking machine a is talking to machine B"
"09-16","23:16","okay but as I mentioned before on one machine we may have a number of"
"09-16","23:24","applications you may have email Web video gaming"
"09-16","23:30","all the other applications okay on B we have the same"
"09-16","23:36","thing a number of applications"
"09-16","23:43","okay so you can say if we think about the applications then when you say"
"09-16","23:49","machine talking to a machine is not accurate right we have to see"
"09-16","23:54","application talking to application"
"09-16","24:04","we can see application A1 is talking to application B1"
"09-16","24:10","okay then we know for application if you have taken the class of 139 probably"
"09-16","24:17","most of you haven't yet okay but we know in our persistence application is just a"
"09-16","24:24","piece of code okay this piece of code usually is on the hard drive"
"09-16","24:31","when you run this piece of code what if the opening system will do is to"
"09-16","24:37","move this piece of code from the hard drive and put it into the memory and"
"09-16","24:42","then begin to run this okay then after this is put into the memory we do"
"09-16","24:49","not call this as application anymore we call it as a process"
"09-16","24:54","so process is basically a running application or a running program"
"09-16","25:01","okay so now you can see if we want to see this more accurately"
"09-16","25:07","machine to machine communication is actually the process to process"
"09-16","25:13","communication okay process to process communication if"
"09-16","25:19","these processes are within the same host then we can see oh two processes are"
"09-16","25:25","communicating using the inter-process communication"
"09-16","25:32","this inter-process communication is defined by the opening system"
"09-16","25:37","but if these processes are within different uh they are in different hosts"
"09-16","25:43","okay then we can see oh they are communicating by exchanging messages"
"09-16","25:50","okay by exchanging messages that's the difference okay that's why actually"
"09-16","25:56","that's why usually at the application layer we always say oh a is sending a"
"09-16","26:01","message to b okay so now if you think about the"
"09-16","26:06","application and the process okay the process also has client process and"
"09-16","26:13","server process okay clients process means the process"
"09-16","26:20","that initiates the communication server process means the process that wish to"
"09-16","26:26","be contacted it's very easy to understand the incline server model usually the processes on"
"09-16","26:34","the client on the client machine or the client processes and then"
"09-16","26:40","processes on the server machine are the server processes because they need to be contacted okay however in P2P model in"
"09-16","26:49","P2P model is not that obvious the how do we Define the client's server"
"09-16","26:57","process so it's the same definition actually okay in P2P model although we"
"09-16","27:03","do not have any clients any servers but still we can say the client processes"
"09-16","27:10","are those processes that initiates communication so if this one process is trying to"
"09-16","27:17","initiate the communication then this becomes the client process then the other machine that is contacted the"
"09-16","27:23","other process that is contacted is the server process okay so that's something"
"09-16","27:29","you need to pay attention all right questions so far about process"
"09-16","27:40","okay all right the next thing we are going to discuss is a very important context"
"09-16","27:46","Concept in networking the socket this is very important okay so now we can look"
"09-16","27:53","at computer a and computer B and each computer you can see"
"09-16","28:01","in terms of networking it has five layers from application layer to transport layer and the network layer"
"09-16","28:07","the link layer the physical layer so I hope these five layers are like they are deeply painted in your mind"
"09-16","28:16","okay so so you you you will have that in your mind forever now okay now we let's"
"09-16","28:22","about talk about the the communication okay so we just learned that we just"
"09-16","28:28","learned one machine may have a number of"
"09-16","28:33","patients okay a number of applications then the right new application or the"
"09-16","28:40","running program is called a process so this process"
"09-16","28:46","is actually living in the now in the application layer okay the process"
"09-16","28:53","resides in the application layer so you can see application layer we have those"
"09-16","28:58","processes okay and as we said if one machine is talking"
"09-16","29:06","to another machine if this processes of it in different machines I I need different machines then we say"
"09-16","29:13","this is a kind this is called as a sending and receiving messages right they need to communicate by exchanging"
"09-16","29:19","the messages so how do we send the message out how do we send the message how do we"
"09-16","29:26","receive the message so what is happening is actually this process"
"09-16","29:32","okay this process will need to compose a message"
"09-16","29:38","like email message uh whatever message okay and then"
"09-16","29:44","push this message down to the transport layer down to the transporter layer so then"
"09-16","29:50","the all the layers below will start to work and then deliver this message"
"09-16","29:58","deliver this message to b okay so then this message will be passed"
"09-16","30:07","from the physical layer up to the transporter layer and then find them to the application layer this is the entire"
"09-16","30:13","process in general okay it's like you are using the Postal"
"09-16","30:19","Service you prepare a package you drop it to The Postal Service post office and"
"09-16","30:25","then they will do the delivery for you okay but there is one very important"
"09-16","30:31","thing here when you try to send this message out when you push this message"
"09-16","30:38","to the transporter layer you need to go through some something called socket"
"09-16","30:45","so this is this yellow box is here"
"09-16","30:51","okay those Yellow Boxes here are actually the sockets the socket is like a door is like a door"
"09-16","30:59","between the application layer and transport a layer so what you do is basically the it's basically plus uh"
"09-16","31:07","push the message through the door okay to deliver the message to the lower"
"09-16","31:14","layer to the transporter layer and then the lower layer will do all the work for you"
"09-16","31:19","similarly when we receive a message okay of course as we said we do not call it a"
"09-16","31:26","message at the other layers right we may call it a segment or a packet or frame okay it doesn't matter it's still the"
"09-16","31:33","core is still the same okay so when we receive this thing okay"
"09-16","31:39","this theme will be delivered from transport layer to the application layer"
"09-16","31:44","through the socket still you need to go in through the store okay so you think"
"09-16","31:50","about think about this this store is like when you use the Postal Service okay it's like your door at your home"
"09-16","31:56","you prepare the package you push the door you push push the package outside of your door"
"09-16","32:02","then the USPS or UPS will come to pick up this"
"09-16","32:09","package outside of your door and do the delivery okay when they arrive at the"
"09-16","32:15","recipient's house okay they will do the same thing drop the door drop the"
"09-16","32:21","package outside of the door and then you can go pick up okay you can pick up your you can get"
"09-16","32:26","your package through the store is this clear to everybody"
"09-16","32:37","okay so this is a uh the concept of socket okay"
"09-16","32:44","your lane usually the this part the process the application layer is"
"09-16","32:51","controlled by the application developer so that means you can make changes there okay and then the layers below are"
"09-16","32:58","controlled by the operating systems that means usually you do not touch that part as a developer okay so those are the"
"09-16","33:07","basic things the uh the other question you you will probably ask is how can we address those"
"09-16","33:14","processes okay uh when we say a process how do we identify them"
"09-16","33:22","okay so it's like when you use Postal Service we know when you send out uh"
"09-16","33:28","something for example if I'm sending something to my friend Michael okay so I"
"09-16","33:33","will say from Sun this is from me okay I'm like a process from Sun to Michael"
"09-16","33:40","Michael is another process okay then we all have the names"
"09-16","33:46","the same thing if we want to add address some processes then they all need to have some identifiers"
"09-16","33:54","okay they all need to have identifiers so you may say oh we know IP address so"
"09-16","34:00","the machine has IP address but think about this as I mentioned for each computer"
"09-16","34:07","you may have IP address right but on this computer you have a multiple"
"09-16","34:15","applications you have multiple processes it's like in my at my home I have"
"09-16","34:23","several people living in my home right we can use the home address but how can we distinguish"
"09-16","34:30","different person that's the question it's the same thing you all you have the"
"09-16","34:35","same IEP for a the same IP address for a but how do you identify"
"09-16","34:41","a1a2a34 those processes right so that's the question that's why"
"09-16","34:47","using only IP address to identify process is not sufficient"
"09-16","34:55","the IP address is able to is only able to identify the host the host computers"
"09-16","35:01","the machines okay then in order to address those processes or to identify"
"09-16","35:07","those processes we need something more okay so what we will use is actually the"
"09-16","35:15","port number okay a port number so that means that means if we want to"
"09-16","35:23","address address a specific process"
"09-16","35:28","we need two information IP address plus a port number"
"09-16","35:35","so you may ask the support number itself work again if you look at this"
"09-16","35:42","uh slide here we may have A1 on computer a right we may also have even on"
"09-16","35:49","computer B so it's because the port numbers are the"
"09-16","35:54","same what numbers are all from 1 to 65 something 65"
"09-16","36:01","000 something of course okay so sorry so those are the port numbers uh each"
"09-16","36:09","machine has those port numbers so we cannot use only uh the port numbers to"
"09-16","36:14","to identify a process we have to use both IP address and phone number okay it's like at our home we may have sun"
"09-16","36:22","and the other um families they may also have somebody names that okay so we need to use both"
"09-16","36:30","the home address and also the name of the person to identify the specific"
"09-16","36:35","person I hope this is clear okay"
"09-16","36:40","so these are some of the example post numbers for http"
"09-16","36:48","for HTTP the server number okay I mean"
"09-16","36:53","for the port number for HTTP server pay attention for hdb server is always"
"09-16","36:58","adding HTTP server the port number is always 80 that means when you contact a server"
"09-16","37:06","HTTP server a web server okay you are always talking to the 80"
"09-16","37:15","port number on that machine it's like if you view a web server as a big house it"
"09-16","37:22","has a 65 more than 65 000 people okay"
"09-16","37:28","you are only talking to that people named 80. okay but as the client HTTP client can"
"09-16","37:35","use any phone numbers okay that's something we are going to discuss more later"
"09-16","37:40","for mail server the port number is always 25 okay always 25. so there is"
"09-16","37:46","one there's one example here you can see to send HD messages to"
"09-16","37:53","gaia.cs.ums.edu web server you need to firstly have the IP address and then you"
"09-16","37:59","need to have the port number okay you need to use both to contact it"
"09-16","38:05","let me look at the question"
"09-16","38:14","one question is it is it like apartment numbers at an apartment complex"
"09-16","38:22","the port being different apartment rooms"
"09-16","38:27","if you view this depends on how how the analysis is down okay if you view the"
"09-16","38:35","entire apartment complex as one unit"
"09-16","38:40","okay as one cost and they all share the same mailing"
"09-16","38:45","address okay I mean all different apartments are sharing the same menu address"
"09-16","38:52","then of course yes you can view those different apartment numbers as different"
"09-16","38:58","both numbers okay yeah other questions"
"09-16","39:11","another question is does Comcast distribute different poll numbers to its"
"09-16","39:17","users this is a good question the answer is no the port numbers are"
"09-16","39:24","usually managed by the operating system because port numbers are associated with"
"09-16","39:30","processes okay processes as I said are applications which are running on one"
"09-16","39:37","machine so that's why the port numbers are usually assigned by the opening"
"09-16","39:42","systems not the internet service provider the internet service provider"
"09-16","39:48","will provides the IP address or the IP address range okay but they do"
"09-16","39:55","not care about the port numbers another question is how many ports that"
"09-16","40:01","an IP address have or does that depend on your ISP or router"
"09-16","40:07","good question so usually for each host each computer"
"09-16","40:13","the port numbers can vary from one two more than 65 It's a 65"
"09-16","40:23","536 I I believe I I maybe this number is not accurate but it's more than 65 000"
"09-16","40:30","okay each cost every host have that many phone numbers"
"09-16","40:36","okay have that many phone numbers then but this doesn't mean all those parts"
"09-16","40:43","should be open okay those parts are like doors okay I like"
"09-16","40:49","some some ports are open samples may not be open okay so for example if this is a web"
"09-16","40:57","server then the web server will only have put 80 open all the other posts may be closed that"
"09-16","41:04","means only this 80 is receiving messages from others from the clients from other"
"09-16","41:12","machines then other ports are all closed okay it's possible and for the clients"
"09-16","41:19","then you may have a number of posts open because if you want to talk to others"
"09-16","41:25","you need to have a phone number open okay so I would say the answer is"
"09-16","41:31","um this does not depend on ISP or router this is again depends on the open system"
"09-16","41:37","I hope this answers all your questions any other questions"
"09-16","41:46","okay great I think you all asked a very very good questions thank you"
"09-16","41:52","all right so um let's talk a little bit more"
"09-19","0:05","all right so um let's talk a little bit more then we stop the class okay"
"09-19","0:12","so uh the next thing we want to discuss is the protocol the protocol basically as I said is like"
"09-19","0:19","a rule between the machines we want we want the machines to understand each other otherwise how can they communicate"
"09-19","0:25","okay they need to all follow the same the same rules okay so basically the"
"09-19","0:31","application layer protocol each layer we have protocol okay here we are talking about only the application layer"
"09-19","0:38","protocol application layer protocol defines the types or messages exchanged like the"
"09-19","0:45","request message the response message and also the message syntax so what are"
"09-19","0:52","the fields in the messages how the fails are deleting delineated okay so those"
"09-19","0:59","are the things defined in each message and then what are the semantics of the"
"09-19","1:07","messages okay what are the semantics that means what are the meaning of information in"
"09-19","1:13","each field okay and also the rules for one and how the processes can send and"
"09-19","1:22","respond to messages so those are all the things defined and there are more okay"
"09-19","1:29","so here you can see there are there are some open protocols uh defined in the"
"09-19","1:35","RFC request for comments documents some of the some of them are like HTTP"
"09-19","1:42","for web SMTP for uh email okay there are also some private protocols like Skype"
"09-19","1:50","okay this is a protocol"
"09-19","1:55","um so pay attention to what are defined here this may become a test question"
"09-19","2:02","I may ask you what are defined by the application layer protocol so you should"
"09-19","2:09","know these are the things that are defined okay next thing we are going to talk about is the services provided by a"
"09-19","2:17","transport layer uh let me see okay so again if this is a computer's five liter"
"09-19","2:25","model one two three four five okay and this is"
"09-19","2:31","a physical layer okay this is uh the link layer definite"
"09-19","2:38","layer Network layer transport layer"
"09-19","2:45","2005 layers and now okay we know for the application layer"
"09-19","2:52","it will need to get service from the transport layer it's like"
"09-19","2:58","if you want to deliver a package you need to get service from USPS"
"09-19","3:04","okay from the post office at USPS okay"
"09-19","3:10","then what kind of service can we get from transport layer or what"
"09-19","3:16","kind of service do we need right does our application need so first thing"
"09-19","3:22","we need reliability transfer it's like if you are using USPS you don't want to"
"09-19","3:27","lose your package right same thing in the uh in the application"
"09-19","3:34","layer the apps need to deliver a message and some applications they require 100"
"09-19","3:41","reliable data transfer why you think about this if you are sending"
"09-19","3:47","out an email do you want to miss some letters in your email"
"09-19","3:53","if you are withdrawing money from a bank or doing transfer"
"09-19","4:00","do you want to miss any numbers right do you want to miss a zero in in"
"09-19","4:07","the transferring amount you do not want right so those applications will require 100"
"09-19","4:14","to Reliable this transfer but there are some applications that do"
"09-19","4:20","not require a 100 reliability transfer they can tolerate some loss"
"09-19","4:26","so what applications can tolerate loss you think about this"
"09-19","4:32","if you are listening to an audio okay for example now if you are listening to me"
"09-19","4:37","when some beats are missed are lost can you still hear me you can still hear"
"09-19","4:45","me right you can still get you if some meat some bits are missing"
"09-19","4:52","that's fine your eye your ears can still can still hear what I'm saying right or"
"09-19","5:00","if you are watching a video do you really care if some pixels are missing"
"09-19","5:06","you do not really care right when you watch the movie if some pixels are missing you can still see this entire"
"09-19","5:12","picture perfectly does this make sense so for those applications we can"
"09-19","5:19","tolerate some loss then those applications do not rely require reliable data transfer at least not 100"
"09-19","5:26","reliable okay that's one service we are talking about data transfer reliability"
"09-19","5:34","second service we want to have is the timing okay for example when you send a package"
"09-19","5:42","to your friend as the as the"
"09-19","5:47","Christmas gift you want to have this package delivered by Christmas right you don't want to"
"09-19","5:54","wait for a year for this application to be it for this package to be delivered"
"09-19","5:59","so timing is also very important especially in some applications such as"
"09-19","6:05","uh telephony or games right we require a low delay to be effective"
"09-19","6:13","in the gaming when you shoot uh Avatar you don't want that to die"
"09-19","6:20","after two hours right the experience would be be really bad so timing is very important"
"09-19","6:28","the next thing throughput so some applications require minimum"
"09-19","6:36","amount of throughput to be effective so some of you may be thinking oh what's the difference between throughput and"
"09-19","6:41","timing it's very different timing means we can wait okay or we cannot wait so"
"09-19","6:48","this email for example this email will be delivered in one day or in two seconds"
"09-19","6:55","okay but throughput means we want to guarantee the minimum amount of"
"09-19","7:01","throughput to be effective for example if you are watching a video you want to guarantee the minimum"
"09-19","7:09","throughput so at least your experience is not bad right if your your movie is not very"
"09-19","7:16","smooth that's because of a low throughput then it will affect your experience of using"
"09-19","7:24","that application okay so that's why some applications require a minimal throughput but some do not okay for"
"09-19","7:31","example for email we do not require throughput you can you can send this"
"09-19","7:37","um you can send in one bit in this second but you can send one one megabits in next second it doesn't really matter"
"09-19","7:43","to me as a lot of the final in my email my email is delivered right"
"09-19","7:51","security we care about if you can provide encryption or data integrity"
"09-19","7:57","okay those kind of features pay attention those are the services"
"09-19","8:04","that we hope we all get we hope we will get right but do we"
"09-19","8:10","really get those it's like we hope we can get reliable"
"09-19","8:16","package delivery from USPS but do we really get reliable packet delivery from"
"09-19","8:22","USPS I don't know maybe or maybe not right"
"09-19","8:27","so let's look at the requirements of this common applications okay"
"09-19","8:35","on the left side in the table on the left side you will see the applications we have file transfer email web"
"09-19","8:41","real-time radio audio etc etc bins okay"
"09-19","8:46","and then let's look at for example uh the file"
"09-19","8:52","transfer for file transfer we cannot afford the data loss that means we"
"09-19","8:59","should not allow any loss for throughput it's elastic we do not care about the robot okay as long as the"
"09-19","9:07","file is finally delivered then we are fine is this time something no we don't care"
"09-19","9:14","okay so that's those are all the requirements for file transfer for"
"09-19","9:20","emails the same thing for web is the same thing but for video okay let's see for video"
"09-19","9:30","for video can we tolerate data loss the answer is yes we can tolerate data"
"09-19","9:38","loss if you lose some bits we don't care do we care about the robot yes vary we"
"09-19","9:44","want to have a minimal throughput so that we can have a good experience okay is this time sensitive yes okay the data"
"09-19","9:53","has to be delivered in a very fast way because this is real time audience video"
"09-19","9:59","excess you can say depending on different applications we require"
"09-19","10:04","different services from the lower layer okay their requirements are different okay"
"09-19","10:11","then now let's come to the transport layer okay we just discussed the application"
"09-19","10:18","layer need this need that they all need this kind of services but at transport layer can we provide"
"09-19","10:26","those services okay it's like if you you want to have"
"09-19","10:32","some services from USPS but let's look at USPS can we provide these Services we"
"09-19","10:39","don't know okay now we are standing here pay attention now we are"
"09-19","10:45","looking at the transport layer we are not looking at the application layer okay"
"09-19","10:51","add transpose layer transport layer provided two type of services"
"09-19","10:57","one is called transmission control protocol service which we know as TCP"
"09-19","11:04","the other one is the user datagram protocol which is UDP"
"09-19","11:09","so please pay attention to the full name okay I remember uh one year I had a"
"09-19","11:18","final exam question called uh what is the full name for TCP"
"09-19","11:24","I thought this is the easiest problem ever but a lot of students didn't get the"
"09-19","11:32","answer and you know what they provided a very creative answers"
"09-19","11:37","so some students said the full name for TCP is truly challenging points"
"09-19","11:45","that's really really creative um so please remember the full name and"
"09-19","11:52","if you cannot remember that you can write it down on your notes uh for the exams I usually allow you to have uh"
"09-19","11:59","change it okay so for TCP again let's come back for TCP"
"09-19","12:06","TCP is one service for this service it provides reliable"
"09-19","12:12","data transfer okay reliable transport between sunny and receiving process that"
"09-19","12:17","means if you choose to use TCP then your data will be delivered eventually okay"
"09-19","12:23","will be guaranteed for delivery it will also provide flow control flow"
"09-19","12:30","control means the sender won't overwhelm the receiver for example if I am sending"
"09-19","12:35","something to my friends okay I'm I'm calling him I'm sending him letters"
"09-19","12:41","every day every hour then he or she will be overwhelmed okay flow control will"
"09-19","12:47","means I cannot do that okay I will be controlled I cannot all around the receiver"
"09-19","12:53","so congestion control means throw to the center when network is overloaded this"
"09-19","12:58","is the same in our flow control but it's very different okay it sounds similar"
"09-19","13:04","but it's very different so conditional control basically means uh the network is already overloaded it's not about the"
"09-19","13:11","receiver it's about the network the network is already loaded so we want to"
"09-19","13:16","stop the sensor from sending uh more packets more quickly"
"09-19","13:23","okay so it's like if I know the traffic is already very very congested on the road if you are all in the classroom I"
"09-19","13:30","won't let you out because I know if you go out you will make the condition even worse okay"
"09-19","13:37","but TCP does not provide service about tiny no minimum throughput guarantee no"
"09-19","13:45","security um and it will also need to establish a"
"09-19","13:52","connection before data exchange okay that means before"
"09-19","13:57","the source and the destination I want to exchange any data they need to firstly agree upon something they need to"
"09-19","14:04","firstly set up a connection okay that's the transport uh sorry"
"09-19","14:09","that's the TCP service so for UDP service UDP provides unreliable data transfer"
"09-19","14:18","that means there are maybe data loss happening okay it doesn't provide any"
"09-19","14:24","reliability no flow control no congestion control no timing no throughput guarantee no security no"
"09-19","14:31","connection setup nothing okay"
"09-19","14:36","so you might be thinking oh uh UDP provide nothing"
"09-19","14:43","then why bother why is there a UDP why do we need it"
"09-19","14:49","okay so later you will learn UDP has a lot of"
"09-19","14:55","um other one it is over TCP okay for example"
"09-19","15:01","because no connection setup is needed so it is much simpler okay"
"09-19","15:08","because um the UDP packet is also much smaller"
"09-19","15:13","much smaller than TCP header the UDP header is much smaller than the TCP"
"09-19","15:18","header it's like when we write a letter okay the TCP header will have a long long uh information on the envelope but"
"09-19","15:27","TCP has a very few information on that envelope okay this is much simpler and"
"09-19","15:33","you save a lot of resources for example you have less beats right less B is used"
"09-19","15:39","for the header so it is smaller the package is smaller"
"09-19","15:44","uh yeah there are a lot more for example because there is no flow control no"
"09-19","15:49","congestion control so the UDP can um use the resources to the most"
"09-19","15:57","potential okay to the most potential um so the data can be sent out really"
"09-19","16:03","fast okay there is no control over uh over the sender okay so a lot of these"
"09-19","16:10","benefits we will learn gradually later for now don't you don't don't need to remember but uh you you should know okay"
"09-19","16:17","there is a reason for UDP being there okay there is a reason"
"09-19","16:23","uh so TCP and UDP again are these are just two kind of uh Services provided by"
"09-19","16:31","transport layer it's like when you walk to the post office okay post office will say oh we have uh the priority mail okay"
"09-19","16:39","we have the express here we have this we have that so the if you pay more money"
"09-19","16:45","then you will get better service right you will have uh we will ensure your package is"
"09-19","16:52","delivered reliably okay but if you pay less if you use just ordinary letters"
"09-19","16:58","okay we cannot ensure that so it's like that it's just different services that are provided by transport layer and the"
"09-19","17:06","application layer has the ability to choose from these two okay application"
"09-19","17:12","layer when you for example you are developing the app okay you can say oh"
"09-19","17:18","my application is a web service for example okay then I need to"
"09-19","17:23","guarantee the reliability to transfer so I need to use TCP"
"09-19","17:28","okay if you are developing an application for video gaming you don't really care about data loss then you can"
"09-19","17:34","say oh I I want to choose UDP okay so you can choose whatever service you like it's like you when you go to SPS you can"
"09-19","17:41","choose what service you like based on your need okay so let me look at the question"
"09-19","17:47","remedy said so TCP is more insured I don't know your what what do you mean by"
"09-19","17:53","insurer do you mean reliability yes yes so TCP is more reliable"
"09-19","18:02","that means whenever you want to send something out using uh TCP your package will be guaranteed to"
"09-19","18:12","be delivered but if you use UDP the data may get lost okay no guarantee over"
"09-19","18:17","reliability does that make sense remember"
"09-19","18:24","okay great and then in this table you can see depending on what application you are"
"09-19","18:31","using we can choose different protocols at the transport layer okay"
"09-19","18:39","for now for the application layer protocol you do not need to remember those for example for email we will use"
"09-19","18:45","SMTP and we want to ensure reliability so we have to use TCP so remote terminal"
"09-19","18:51","access this is for um usually typing some command in terminal right so we also want to ensure"
"09-19","18:58","reliability so TCP uh web TCP again because we need reliability file"
"09-19","19:04","transfer we need TCP because reliability streaming multimedia not necessarily"
"09-19","19:11","okay we can use either TCP or UDP okay because we may afford the losing data"
"09-19","19:17","think about this this is the multimedia the movie the pictures if the audience"
"09-19","19:23","if you lose some beats it doesn't really affect you watching the movie watching the picture or listening to the audio"
"09-19","19:30","right so it's fine that's why we can use TCP or UDP for internet telephone name"
"09-19","19:36","we again we can use gcp or UDP okay so you can you can say depending on what application you are using we can choose"
"09-19","19:43","what protocol we will use at the transport layer and then the last thing"
"09-19","19:49","about this section is the securing TCP and if you look at the"
"09-19","19:56","um the features of gcp and UDP we know both of them do not provide any security"
"09-19","20:04","okay both of them do not provide any security so then some of you may ask oh"
"09-19","20:10","uh then what if I want to have some security right I don't want my password"
"09-19","20:17","to be sent in clear text right um so then what can we do so as I"
"09-19","20:24","mentioned before if you want to in uh add any security then you have to"
"09-19","20:29","implement the security in the application layer how can we do that we"
"09-19","20:35","use something called secure socket layer okay is this another layer on top of the"
"09-19","20:42","Internet Protocol stack no this is actually within the application layer"
"09-19","20:49","okay um although it's also called a layer but it's not really a layer in the internet"
"09-19","20:54","okay so the SSL can be used to provide the"
"09-19","21:00","encrypted TCP connection it can provide the data integrity and it can also"
"09-19","21:06","provide the endpoint authentication so what it does is generally uh it's so for"
"09-19","21:13","example if you have your password or whatever text okay that is in plain text okay"
"09-19","21:21","then when it goes through the SSL the SL SSL will add a layer of encryption okay"
"09-19","21:29","basically uh the application Will Call some encryption functionality functions"
"09-19","21:35","okay in the API to encrypt the data and then send the data out okay so it's like"
"09-19","21:40","that um when I see send it out I mean push it down to the transport layer okay"
"09-19","21:49","um so SSL is application layer as I mentioned uh applications use the SSL"
"09-19","21:56","libraries which talk to the TCP okay so basically you firstly call SSL libraries"
"09-19","22:02","and those libraries will will talk to the TCP or"
"09-19","22:07","UDP okay so SL SSL socket API is able to"
"09-19","22:13","encrypt the clear test messages or password or whatever"
"09-19","22:18","um and then send them into the internet okay so any questions"
"09-19","22:30","all right so starting from 2.2 we are going to discuss uh each application as"
"09-19","22:36","you can see we will talk about web email DNS P2P videos okay uh as I mentioned"
"09-19","22:43","after we finish 2.2 we are going to talk about 2.7 and then we come back come"
"09-19","22:49","come back to the email okay all right so let's first think about the"
"09-19","22:55","uh web application you are using the app web application almost every day right we use web browsers"
"09-19","23:03","um when you display when you have a web page on your uh web browser so that has"
"09-19","23:09","Firefox okay uh what is displayed what is really displayed okay so basically"
"09-19","23:17","um a web page consists of objects okay so then what is object"
"09-19","23:24","sorry my sign is screaming um so the object is uh is a HTML or jpeg"
"09-19","23:34","or Java application applet or audio file okay so it can be a lot of things okay"
"09-19","23:41","so basically when your web browser load a web page it's not really loading one"
"09-19","23:47","whole thing okay it's loading a number of objects including the HTML file"
"09-19","23:54","itself and which and also the the images the audience the videos which are"
"09-19","24:00","inserted into this HTML file okay that's why sometimes uh for example your"
"09-19","24:07","internet is not very very uh very good when your bandwidth is very low for"
"09-19","24:13","example okay the web browser may be able to load the"
"09-19","24:18","HTML file because it's usually a small files just the text right"
"09-19","24:24","um but it may not be able to load the images or the videos okay then that's"
"09-19","24:29","why sometimes you can see the the web page is not displayed correctly okay"
"09-19","24:35","um the web page consists of Base HTML file which includes several"
"09-19","24:41","reference objects okay each object is addressable by a URL"
"09-19","24:48","uh I think probably you've already had some experience uh before with HTML"
"09-19","24:53","right I'm not sure if our our computer science courses cover that part uh but"
"09-19","25:01","you all know that when you write the HTML file if you want to insert something for example if you want to"
"09-19","25:07","insert a PDF or image you need to refer to that object okay and then that object"
"09-19","25:15","will be included into that web page okay"
"09-19","25:21","and then when you want to and we want to um"
"09-19","25:26","um let's see um display uh web page sorry uh email sorry what"
"09-19","25:35","I'm saying when you want to display an image okay or a PDF okay then you can"
"09-19","25:41","use a URL to uh refer to that object okay for example here you can see if we"
"09-19","25:47","want to display a J file okay so you can just say uh"
"09-19","25:54","homeschool.edu some Department slash pic.gif okay so usually what what is all"
"09-19","26:02","so this is organized in some way okay firstly on this web server this is the hostname this is the server okay on this"
"09-19","26:09","hostname there is actually a folder called some Department okay and under this folder"
"09-19","26:17","you will say pic.gif that's how you are able to uh get to that picture"
"09-19","26:23","okay and uh if you have the experience building your own website you you can"
"09-19","26:29","you can try this okay for example for my website I'm able to do"
"09-19","26:36","athena.ecs.csus.edu and then slash something one folder slash another sub photo slash another sub folder and"
"09-19","26:41","finally reach a PDF file or my picture okay so I select that"
"09-19","26:50","and then okay and then when we want to"
"09-19","26:55","um request for web page okay your web browser is actually"
"09-19","27:02","communicating with the web server and requesting for that web page okay so"
"09-19","27:09","it's like uh you are making HTTP request to that server and the server response"
"09-19","27:14","response with the ATM file and all the referred objects okay similarly for your"
"09-19","27:22","phone it's the same thing okay so what is used in this process is called HTTP"
"09-19","27:29","HTTP is a protocol so what is the protocol we mentioned it's just"
"09-19","27:35","um like rules right it's like how can they understand each other we follow"
"09-19","27:40","protocol then the uh the the both machines can understand each other okay"
"09-19","27:49","so um HTTP the full name is hypertext transfer protocol this protocol is used"
"09-19","27:57","for web application only okay sometimes of course email sometimes"
"09-19","28:03","we also use HTTP but you know the base is still the web application okay"
"09-19","28:09","and uh for for HTTP we usually use it in"
"09-19","28:14","a client server model OKAY the client again do still remember what we said last time when we see in a client we"
"09-19","28:22","usually mean uh a client program right or client process when we see the server"
"09-19","28:29","it usually means a server program on server process okay it's not just the"
"09-19","28:36","machine okay so here the client is the browser"
"09-19","28:41","to say is the browser which is a client program the browser that request"
"09-19","28:47","receives and displays the web objects okay then the server basically is the"
"09-19","28:54","web server okay that sends web server program also okay sends the objects in"
"09-19","29:01","response to the request okay and the client and server they are using HTTP to"
"09-19","29:06","talk to each other all right any questions so far"
"09-19","29:12","okay all right so that's the application layer when we come down"
"09-19","29:19","to this application layer we know we are using HTTP protocol okay"
"09-19","29:27","but as we mentioned at transport layer we need to choose one protocol"
"09-19","29:35","so here can you tell me which protocol do we use TCP or UDP can"
"09-19","29:42","you guess you can type your answer in the chat foreign"
"09-19","29:50","TCP okay"
"09-19","29:56","Matthew said TCP Anthony said TTP okay Michael said we need a response great"
"09-19","30:03","voice is also mentioned TCP excellent view are all correct so some of you may say oh you have the answer on"
"09-19","30:09","the slide yes but still I want you to think about this why do we use TCP"
"09-19","30:15","because we want to guarantee reliability right when you request for a web page"
"09-19","30:22","you want your request to be delivered correctly and you also want that web"
"09-19","30:27","page to be delivered correctly that's why we want to ensure reliability at transport layer that's why we want to"
"09-19","30:34","use TCP okay so generally what will happen is the client side will initiate"
"09-19","30:39","the TCP connection okay so it will create a socket"
"09-19","30:44","um this and then talk to the server okay and the server is listening to Port 80."
"09-19","30:51","do you remember this port it's a very very famous Port 80 is for web"
"09-19","30:57","application okay again it's client is the client initiating this connection say hey can I"
"09-19","31:04","talk to you okay then the server is listening to 80 when it's it constantly"
"09-19","31:09","checks Port 80 okay Port 80 is associated with a socket with the"
"09-19","31:16","servers socket okay and then the server accepts this TCP"
"09-19","31:21","connection from the client and say oh yes sure let's talk okay after that then"
"09-19","31:28","um the the uh client will send in that HTTP messages okay so uh request message"
"09-19","31:36","and then the server will respond with HTTP response message okay so then the"
"09-19","31:42","18 messages are exchanged between the browser and the server uh using HTTP"
"09-19","31:48","HTTP protocol okay finally after they are done they are all very happy and"
"09-19","31:54","then the TCP connection is closed so this is the entire process and pay attention TC HTTP is stateless"
"09-19","32:02","what does this mean this means the server side maintains no information"
"09-19","32:09","about past client requests it doesn't remember anything the server doesn't"
"09-19","32:15","remember the past requests okay so some of you may say that's not correct that's"
"09-19","32:22","not true uh for example when I use a web browser"
"09-19","32:27","to buy something okay I added this thing into the cart and I've got to make the pressures right"
"09-19","32:36","I may uh decide to come back after a month"
"09-19","32:41","okay or at least after weeks a week okay and then I want to purchase that thing"
"09-19","32:48","again and I notice that thing is still in my cart because I added that into my"
"09-19","32:54","card okay does this mean the server already remembered the information about past"
"09-19","33:01","client request this means yes yes the server remembers"
"09-19","33:07","but that's not because of HTTP okay that's because of something else we are"
"09-19","33:13","going to discuss it later okay for now keep in mind HTTP is stateless it"
"09-19","33:18","doesn't maintain any information about past client requests okay"
"09-19","33:25","uh the reason why we don't use a protocol that maintains that is because"
"09-19","33:31","usually those Protocols are very complex okay you you can you think about this"
"09-19","33:36","you need to remember all the past history okay if the server or client"
"09-19","33:42","crashes their views of state may be inconsistent okay so that's the main thing that's why we want the protocol to"
"09-19","33:49","be as simple as possible okay so uh any questions so far"
"09-19","34:00","okay all right so now let's talk about the two types of HTTP one type is called"
"09-19","34:06","non-persistent either type is persistent so what are their difference"
"09-19","34:13","um for non-persistent http each time when we establish a TCP"
"09-19","34:21","connection we can send at most one object"
"09-19","34:26","okay and then we have to close the connection that means if this web page has multiple"
"09-19","34:34","objects let's see 10 objects okay then each time"
"09-21","0:03","if the server or client crashes their views of state may be inconsistent okay"
"09-21","0:09","so that's the main thing that's why we want the protocol to be as simple as possible okay"
"09-21","0:16","so uh any questions so far"
"09-21","0:23","okay all right so now let's talk about the two types of HTTP one type is called"
"09-21","0:30","non-persistent either type is persistent so what are their difference"
"09-21","0:36","um for non-persistent http each time when we establish a TCP"
"09-21","0:44","connection we can send at most one object"
"09-21","0:50","okay and then we have to close the connection that means if this web page has multiple"
"09-21","0:57","objects let's say 10 objects okay then each time we can only get one"
"09-21","1:07","object and we have to make 10 Connections in order to get that 10"
"09-21","1:13","objects okay it's like when you call your mom"
"09-21","1:18","say uh you want to request something for lunch okay uh you say every time you"
"09-21","1:26","make a phone call you can only request for one object the first time you call"
"09-21","1:31","your mom and say Mom can I have an egg okay then you"
"09-21","1:37","uh you you you you you you should drop the phone call okay and then the second time you make a phone call again and say"
"09-21","1:44","Mom can I have a box of milk okay then the phone call is over and then third time we want to request to"
"09-21","1:51","for example then you will see Mom you may make a phone call again say Mom can I have an apple"
"09-21","1:56","okay so for our every object you have to make a connection okay"
"09-21","2:02","persistent HTTP is different in personal HTTP multiple objects can be"
"09-21","2:09","sent over a single TCP connection between client and server okay"
"09-21","2:15","so that means if you have a web page that contains multiple objects okay you"
"09-21","2:23","don't you do not need to make multiple connections you only need to make one connection and then you will get a"
"09-21","2:30","multiple objects for example it's like you call your mom and say Mom can I have a neck uh and box a box of milk and an"
"09-21","2:39","apple so you request for them together and then your mom will deliver all those things together to you okay so it's like"
"09-21","2:45","that uh let's look at an example of the non-processing hcp question so far"
"09-21","2:57","okay so now let's say this user is requesting"
"09-21","3:03","for this web page okay this is the URL and this web page"
"09-21","3:10","you can see this home.index is the base"
"09-21","3:18","HTML file okay this file"
"09-21","3:23","contains or refers to 10 jpeg images Okay can it contains not only the test"
"09-21","3:30","but also refers to 10 jpeg images so as you can imagine now we have actually in"
"09-21","3:37","total we have 11 objects the index file itself and 10 other images okay so then at the very"
"09-21","3:46","beginning the HTTP client initiates the TCP connection to the HTTP server"
"09-21","3:52","at some school.edu on Port 80."
"09-21","3:58","paying attention uh here the client has to initiate the"
"09-21","4:05","TCP connection first okay then the server add host some school.edu"
"09-21","4:13","is waiting for the TCP connection at Port 80. so the server is constantly checking Port 80 and see if there is"
"09-21","4:20","incoming request now we have I'm Inc incoming requests then the server will"
"09-21","4:25","accept the connection and notify the client to say yes let's connect okay"
"09-21","4:30","then the clientele will say oh okay uh the connection is established so the"
"09-21","4:36","client can now send the HTTP request message to say hey I want to get this"
"09-21","4:41","home.index web page okay so this request is pushed into the"
"09-21","4:49","socket do you remember the socket the socket is like a door between the"
"09-21","4:54","application layer and the transporter layer right so um so then this required message is"
"09-21","5:01","pushed into the transport layer okay then further the transporter layer and the layers below will take care of this"
"09-21","5:08","request message right so the message indicates that client the"
"09-21","5:14","client wants object some Department slash home.index okay now the server"
"09-21","5:20","receives the request message and then the server say oh okay I need to prepare for uh for the response okay"
"09-21","5:29","so then the several forms a response message containing the requested object"
"09-21","5:34","which is the index file and sends a message into the socket"
"09-21","5:40","again the server side it needs to push push the message into"
"09-21","5:46","the socket you remember this is application layer transport"
"09-21","5:52","layer okay between application layer there is something called socket"
"09-21","5:59","Right add to the client sign at the book and the server side they both have a socket right so then the server push"
"09-21","6:06","this response message through the socket and then this message is sent to the"
"09-21","6:12","client okay after that the HTTP server say oh okay I'm done with my job so it"
"09-21","6:19","will close the TCP connection pay attention so far we only sent out"
"09-21","6:26","one object which is the index"
"09-21","6:31","um the index file the home.index file okay"
"09-21","6:37","uh and the index file still refers to 10 more jpeg objects we haven't sent those"
"09-21","6:45","jpeg objects yet okay so now the HTTP client received the response message"
"09-21","6:51","containing the atmf file it will displace the HTML and then it will also"
"09-21","6:57","pass the HTML and find okay in addition to this HTML file it also refers to 10"
"09-21","7:06","jpeg objects okay then with this information"
"09-21","7:12","what the client will do is go back to Step One repeat each step from one to five"
"09-21","7:21","in order to get the 10 jpeg objects okay"
"09-21","7:27","so um now let's look at the response time"
"09-21","7:32","okay let's look at the response time firstly let's define"
"09-21","7:38","this rtt do you still remember rtt I think I mentioned this before round"
"09-21","7:44","trip time okay your level will discuss"
"09-21","7:50","response time we mean the the round trip time okay round trip time means the time"
"09-21","7:57","for a small package to travel from client to server and then back so you're"
"09-21","8:04","at the back it's not the package coming back it's the response coming back okay how about the response time"
"09-21","8:11","which means if we want to get all those objects the one etm file and the 10"
"09-21","8:18","reference the JPEG files if we get this full web page downloaded"
"09-21","8:25","then how much time how much time do we need"
"09-21","8:31","okay so before we end we we go go further to discuss that let's first"
"09-21","8:38","discuss one definition that is called rtt a"
"09-21","8:49","okay this is the time for small package to travel from client to server and then"
"09-21","8:56","back this is a like one RTG it's like when you write a letter to your friend"
"09-21","9:02","in New York and then your your friend is replying you a letter okay then finally"
"09-21","9:08","you receive the reply letter this is a round trip time okay"
"09-21","9:15","so as you can see as you can see in one H in the non-person HTTP okay we need to"
"09-21","9:22","we firstly need one rtt to initiate the TCP connection so the first one this one"
"09-21","9:29","is for making the connection it's like for you make a phone call with your mouth okay so can I talk with you the"
"09-21","9:37","server say yes sure let's talk this is one rtt okay after that"
"09-21","9:43","after that we need another rtk to make the request for the web page right for"
"09-21","9:49","the HTML file so then the server will see the client will see"
"09-21","9:57","hey can I get this index file the server will say sure you can"
"09-21","10:05","this is another rtt right one rtt after that the server will in of course in"
"09-21","10:13","that um in that response message several will also sent out the data for the ATM file"
"09-21","10:21","right you you may imagine this is a this is a file it takes time to transmit"
"09-21","10:27","okay so then we can see we need a little bit time here to"
"09-21","10:33","transmit this object okay to transmit this object then in total how much height we need"
"09-21","10:41","for sending one object if you look at that okay in total we are we need"
"09-21","10:49","2 rtt plus the file transmission time"
"09-21","10:54","pay attention this is just for the HTML file okay"
"09-21","11:00","but we still have 10 objects to images right to 10 jpeg images to transfer okay"
"09-21","11:08","and pay attention for non-person http we need"
"09-21","11:16","this much time for each object because every time we need to make a new code we"
"09-21","11:22","need to make a new connection okay so that means for image one you"
"09-21","11:27","need two rtt plus file transmission time for email two you need"
"09-21","11:32","one or two rtt plus file transmission type so then if you have n objects in total"
"09-21","11:42","foreign objects are the same size but usually"
"09-21","11:50","they are not the same size okay let's assume they are the same size"
"09-21","11:59","okay then the total time"
"09-21","12:06","total time needed equals to"
"09-21","12:19","okay equals to n times 2 rtt plus the"
"09-21","12:25","file transmission time okay or you can see if they are not the"
"09-21","12:30","same size you can say 2 and rtt plus the file transmission time for all the"
"09-21","12:37","objects that's also fine okay any questions here"
"09-21","12:49","no questions okay the hot rod persistent http"
"09-21","12:55","for percent HTTP we know the server the server we'll leave the connection open"
"09-21","13:03","after sending the response okay that means that after the server sending the HTML file it will not close the"
"09-21","13:11","connection okay here for the client still want to get more objects the client can make"
"09-21","13:17","requests again okay the client can make a request again"
"09-21","13:22","so that in this case in this case if we think about the transmission time the"
"09-21","13:29","total time needed okay so then foreign"
"09-21","13:42","Ty"
"09-21","13:48","how many are how many connections do we need to make for all the objects"
"09-21","13:55","think about this how many connections do we need to make for all the objects"
"09-21","14:02","we need only one right we need only one connection"
"09-21","14:11","equal one rtt for making connections plus after that you can transmit"
"09-21","14:19","multiple files right you can request and uh the client can request for multiple"
"09-21","14:27","objects and for each object again we need one rtt plus the file transmission"
"09-21","14:32","type right so now if we consider we have n objects the total time equals to rtt"
"09-21","14:40","rtt means for connection"
"09-21","14:48","so this rtt first rtt is for making TCP connection"
"09-21","15:09","the the second part is the rtt plus ftt this is the time needed"
"09-21","15:16","for the client to make a request to the server and also for the server to"
"09-21","15:22","respond and transmitted object okay if we have n objects then of course we need"
"09-21","15:29","n times uh rtt Plus ftt okay so this is the total Time for"
"09-21","15:35","persistent http so if you think about it if you compare this with the non-presidentiality we"
"09-21","15:43","basically save time for the TCP connection"
"09-21","15:49","okay so here you can see"
"09-21","15:54","every time we need to rtt but for percent HTTP we only need one"
"09-21","16:00","rtt as a verb again okay it's like for nine percent GDP"
"09-21","16:06","every time you need to call your mom okay uh when you need a new object so"
"09-21","16:11","then you need the time to make the phone call that is the extra compared to persistently CP as I said we made an"
"09-21","16:19","assumption that is these objects are the same size then you can do you can use this function okay"
"09-21","16:25","but if these objects are not the same size then the f t t will be different"
"09-21","16:31","for each object so one object may take an hour another object may use only five"
"09-21","16:36","seconds okay then in that case you cannot do a simple like and times something okay"
"09-21","16:43","then you will use uh you can see all the file transmission type for all the"
"09-21","16:49","objects okay uh then you do not do this kind of multiplication"
"09-21","16:54","uh oh one more thing I want to mention is that for none percentage GDP okay"
"09-21","17:01","usually the browser the browser can make parallel TCP connections to fetch the"
"09-21","17:10","reference objects okay so if it has 10 objects it can open 10 TCP connections"
"09-21","17:16","it's like you can open 10 uh tabs in the browser to request for for the object"
"09-21","17:24","okay the next thing I'm going to discuss is about the request and the response"
"09-21","17:31","message format Okay so we talk about the request message then how do we really make a request okay"
"09-21","17:40","um basically for the request message you can see uh the left part this part is a"
"09-21","17:47","is the is a one request message example okay so for the request message it is written"
"09-21","17:54","in Oscar it is human readable okay then there is"
"09-21","17:59","one line called request line this request request line is usually composed"
"09-21","18:05","of some commands let's get post or hat we will discuss"
"09-21","18:10","the other commands later okay but the first one I need to know is the get this is one command okay then after the test"
"09-21","18:18","you want to tell what things you want to get you tell the server"
"09-21","18:25","I want to get this index.etml object"
"09-21","18:30","okay if you want to get something else you can also specify it here so this is"
"09-21","18:36","a get and after that after that you need to specify your foreign here in this"
"09-21","18:43","example it is HTTP 1.1 after that you need to add a calorie"
"09-21","18:49","return and align fader slash on slash n to indicate this is the end of the get"
"09-21","18:56","line of the request line okay after that after the request line"
"09-21","19:01","we have a number of header lines okay those header lines includes including"
"09-21","19:09","information about this request okay so for example"
"09-21","19:16","this host is about the server so which what is the server you are making"
"09-21","19:23","requests from okay and you are making requests too so is this the this is then this is usually"
"09-21","19:31","the web server where you you put the hostname okay then the user agent"
"09-21","19:36","is what kind of client client program you are using for example this is this client is used in Firefox okay"
"09-21","19:44","so then those ones those accept things are talking about"
"09-21","19:51","the uh language the encoding method Etc so those those information okay"
"09-21","19:59","foreign means this is a persistent http"
"09-21","20:07","okay which means this connection will keep alive for 115 seconds probably okay"
"09-21","20:15","I don't know the units but most likely seconds okay and then"
"09-21","20:21","connection this is seeing again this is a persistent HTTP okay after that we add"
"09-21","20:28","a line region category term to indicate this is the end of the header lines so"
"09-21","20:34","this is the format of the request message I have given you the one shot lab"
"09-21","20:41","the worship lab includes um"
"09-21","20:47","uh it includes uh some basic operations okay and you will need to look into"
"09-21","20:56","those packets so one of the message you will look into is the HTTP request"
"09-21","21:01","message and you you are going to see exactly the same thing as you see here okay"
"09-21","21:07","um exactly the same thing I don't mean the information inside I mean this format is"
"09-21","21:13","exactly the same okay and if you look at this uh General"
"09-21","21:19","format again so how do we represent this because when we send this request"
"09-21","21:25","message this request message is basically a bunch of zeros and ones right then how do we represent that in"
"09-21","21:31","reality so we first method here"
"09-21","21:39","we put a get or some other commands here okay and then this is the URL"
"09-21","21:45","what else can be foreign"
"09-21","22:01","PNG okay that's also fine and the word number"
"09-21","22:09","can be HTTP 1.1 or 1.0 so basically you can see I'm I'm mapping that to here"
"09-21","22:17","okay after that you can see you have cut return and line fader slash R selection okay and after that"
"09-21","22:25","the second row the second row is you have the header field name the header"
"09-21","22:30","can be host it can be uh accept Etc okay then you have the header for"
"09-21","22:37","each header you have the value for each field you have the value and then you have category trendline fader okay"
"09-21","22:43","finally after all these are done you have another card return and line"
"09-21","22:49","failure to indicate this is the end of the HTTP request message okay and then you have the entity body"
"09-21","22:58","okay the antenna body uh sometimes or some data okay that you need to upload"
"09-21","23:04","to the server okay sometimes it's empty sometimes it may not be empty"
"09-21","23:11","and"
"09-21","23:16","okay so I mentioned get is one method there are"
"09-21","23:25","also other methods like post URL okay"
"09-21","23:30","and hats and more okay let's first look at the post method what is post"
"09-21","23:35","so the web page often often includes some form input so this this input uh"
"09-21","23:42","will need to be filled by the client okay so the client will need to upload"
"09-21","23:48","this input to the server usually this is done in the entity body so in this case we can use the post"
"09-21","23:57","method okay or we can also use the URL method the"
"09-21","24:03","URL methods is actually still is is although it's called UIL method but"
"09-21","24:09","still it's using the get in the master field so here I mean the method here is"
"09-21","24:15","still using get the difference is okay the difference is"
"09-21","24:21","if we are using like a regular get okay if you're using a regular get"
"09-21","24:27","method for example if you want if you're doing a Google search you want you want to search for monkey and another okay"
"09-21","24:35","then usually what you have to you have to do is you upload your monkey and"
"09-21","24:41","bananas keyword in the entity body okay in the entity body"
"09-21","24:48","that is you when you are using a regular get method okay but if you want to use"
"09-21","24:55","URL method now what you will do is you can still use get okay"
"09-21","25:00","you still use get but you will upload the keywords directly"
"09-21","25:06","in the URL okay so for example here you can see"
"09-21","25:12","this is the URL you will put in the uh in the UIL field so you can see the"
"09-21","25:19","keywords monkey and the banana is actually already included in the URL"
"09-21","25:25","itself so in this case you don't need to upload it into the entity body field"
"09-21","25:31","okay there is one question is this HTTP"
"09-21","25:36","request being sent during the first rtt or the second rtt that's this is a good"
"09-21","25:42","question so let's quickly review this again"
"09-21","25:49","the first rtt is for making TCP connection connection is for making the"
"09-21","25:55","phone call like phone call to your mom right so it's just saying hey can I connect with you the server say yes sure"
"09-21","26:02","let's connect that's that's the only thing they do in this rtt they do not"
"09-21","26:07","make any requests for objects okay so that in the second rtt after the"
"09-21","26:13","connection is is a is made is established then in a second rtt the"
"09-21","26:18","client will say hey can I get a web page it is making a HTTP request in the"
"09-21","26:25","second rtt okay so in this case I will say most of the"
"09-21","26:31","time most of the time we are making ATP quests in the second RTP"
"09-21","26:38","that this answer a question"
"09-21","26:44","okay good that's a good question"
"09-21","26:50","um we just mentioned the post method the URL method okay these methods are for"
"09-21","26:56","uploading uploading the form input okay you can use posts or you can use the URL"
"09-21","27:03","and there are some other methods in both HTTP 1.0 and 180 1.1"
"09-21","27:10","so for example for 1.0 we have get method post method and also"
"09-21","27:16","had method so this is where this method is very"
"09-21","27:23","interesting this one is asking the server to leave"
"09-21","27:28","the requested object out of response okay that means for example"
"09-21","27:36","um you are you you are the client is making a request of our"
"09-21","27:42","image okay the image may be huge maybe big right and then several very response"
"09-21","27:47","usually irregular get methods the server will respond with a"
"09-21","27:53","the object right and say hey this is the image here it is I'll send it to you so"
"09-21","27:59","then this image is transmitted to the client"
"09-21","28:05","okay of course it will take a very long time if especially if this is a large"
"09-21","28:11","object but we've had a method it is still asking the server about this"
"09-21","28:18","object and the server will still respond but the server will respond with all the"
"09-21","28:25","other information except the object the object is not included in"
"09-21","28:30","the response that means all the information are sent back but the image itself is not sent back"
"09-21","28:37","so then you may ask why do we use that why do we use a hat"
"09-21","28:43","okay most of the time most of the time this has is usually for like for example for testing debugging uh to to say if"
"09-21","28:51","this object is is available on the server okay but the object is not it"
"09-21","28:57","does not need to be really sent back to the client okay that is the purpose for"
"09-21","29:02","help and then for ATP 1.1 we have uh two more"
"09-21","29:10","uh so one is put put is to upload the files in entity body to the path"
"09-21","29:16","specified in the URL field this is also for uploading information another method"
"09-21","29:22","is delete delete is a delay to the file specified in the UIL field okay so those"
"09-21","29:27","are the methods used in um HTTP 1.1 and 1.0 any questions"
"09-21","29:40","okay um so for the response message as you"
"09-21","29:45","can see for the response message uh one line the first line is this the stance line"
"09-21","29:52","first line Stateline so it will indicate that version of HTTP and with a status"
"09-21","29:58","quo [Music] so this 200 is the status code"
"09-21","30:05","it means okay it means everything is fine the the"
"09-21","30:11","image the or the object you are requesting is available okay and I'm"
"09-21","30:17","going to send it to you that basically it's many okay so then you can see later after this status line you can see a"
"09-21","30:25","number of header lines so in the headlines again we have some information like a date"
"09-21","30:32","date is the response date and time okay server what is the server Apache"
"09-21","30:39","server in this case last modified this is very important foreign"
"09-21","30:46","date and time for the object this means this object was last modified"
"09-21","30:54","in 2007. okay and this is very important"
"09-21","30:59","information later I'll tell you why okay for now you don't need to know after that now you can see e-tag accept ranges"
"09-21","31:07","content length Etc and then you can see keep alive again this indicates this is"
"09-21","31:12","a HTTP processing http time out equal to 10 Max equal to 100 so"
"09-21","31:20","your latest means okay after I'm done with this object I'll wait for 10 more"
"09-21","31:26","seconds okay I'll keep this uh uh connection open for 10 more seconds"
"09-21","31:32","and within this 10 more seconds you can if you if I receive more requests I will"
"09-21","31:37","respond if I do not receive more requests then I will end this session"
"09-21","31:43","and this this will time out okay but I want to be alarmed forever"
"09-21","31:50","okay so this connection can only be open for 100 seconds for example okay that"
"09-21","31:57","means no matter if you have more requests I don't care after 100 seconds I will"
"09-21","32:03","close this connection okay this is also for protection uh for protecting the"
"09-21","32:08","server because we don't want the server to be occupied by a client forever okay because we know if we make"
"09-21","32:17","this open to the client forever then we can easily the server can easily suffer"
"09-21","32:22","from the detox attack Etc okay and then again connection is means this is a"
"09-21","32:30","non-president HTTP okay so content type and then all the data"
"09-21","32:36","will be sent after that so the data here means uh those uh"
"09-21","32:42","requested HTML files or images Etc so they are included here"
"09-21","32:48","so these are some of the other status codes okay we just mentioned to handle"
"09-21","32:54","okay and you can also have three one four four four four four uh for for 400 bad"
"09-21","33:01","requests and also four for Four Points a very common one you see it's a lot of times and you can also have 505 okay so"
"09-21","33:10","these are the sample codes for the HTTP response you can actually try telnet try"
"09-21","33:17","HTTP on your first self uh so basically what you do is you just"
"09-21","33:24","um try to tell that to the web server okay tell net to one web server uh"
"09-21","33:31","basically uh it's like you are talking to that web server directly okay not go"
"09-21","33:37","not through the web browser but through the uh terminal okay through the"
"09-21","33:43","terminal you directly talk to that machine for example you can open a TCP connection to Port 80 at"
"09-21","33:51","cis.poly.edu of course you can do csus.edu okay you can connect to Port 80"
"09-21","33:58","to csus.edu or even other servers okay just try your favorite web servers and"
"09-21","34:05","then you can type in a get message a get message to requests for a"
"09-21","34:12","um for uh object okay it can be a web page it can be an image or PDF whatever"
"09-21","34:18","you like okay then you can look at the response message uh sent by the ATP server okay so I did"
"09-21","34:27","some tests for you okay so you can see here"
"09-21","34:32","here what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to connect I'm using telnet trying to"
"09-21","34:39","connect to cs.umass gaia.cs.umass.edu"
"09-21","34:46","okay at Port 80. 480 is the phone number for web service"
"09-21","34:53","we have mentioned this from many times right basically at the server side pay"
"09-21","34:59","attention at the server side the server is opening this support 80."
"09-21","35:04","it's like a door it's opening this door and then the server will constantly check this port and see if there there"
"09-21","35:12","are any incoming requests okay the client side does not need to use 80"
"09-21","35:19","because 80 is a forward server okay client-side also need to have a door"
"09-21","35:24","open in order to communicate with"
"09-23","0:00","really trying"
"09-23","0:01","talented try HTTP on your first self so"
"09-23","0:06","basically what you do is you just"
"09-23","0:09","try to tell next to the web server okay"
"09-23","0:13","tell net to one web server basically"
"09-23","0:17","it's like you are talking to that web"
"09-23","0:19","server directly okay not go not through"
"09-23","0:23","the web browser but through the terminal"
"09-23","0:27","okay through the terminal you directly"
"09-23","0:29","talk to that machine for example you can"
"09-23","0:32","open a TCP connection to Port 80 at"
"09-23","0:36","cis.poly.edu of course you can do"
"09-23","0:40","csus.edu okay you can connect to Port 80"
"09-23","0:43","to csus.edu or even other servers okay"
"09-23","0:47","just try your favorite web servers and"
"09-23","0:50","then you can type in a get message"
"09-23","0:53","a get message to request for a"
"09-23","0:57","um for object okay it can be a web page"
"09-23","1:01","it can be an image or PDF whatever you"

"09-23","1:06","response message"
"09-23","1:08","sent by the ATP server okay so I did"
"09-23","1:12","some tests for you okay so you can see"
"09-23","1:16","here"
"09-23","1:17","here what I'm trying to do is I'm trying"
"09-23","1:20","to connect I'm using telnet trying to"
"09-23","1:24","connect to"
"09-23","1:26","cs.umass gaia.cs.ums.edu"
"09-23","1:31","okay at Port 80."
"09-23","1:34","480 is the phone number for web service"
"09-23","1:38","we have mentioned this from many times"
"09-23","1:40","right basically at the server side pay"
"09-23","1:44","attention at the server side"
"09-23","1:46","the server is opening this support 80."
"09-23","1:49","it's like a door it's opening this door"
"09-23","1:51","and then the server will constantly"
"09-23","1:54","check this port and see if there there"
"09-23","1:57","are any incoming requests okay the"
"09-23","2:01","client side does not need to use 80"
"09-23","2:04","because 80 is a full web server okay"
"09-23","2:06","client-side also need to have a door"
"09-23","2:09","open in order to communicate with others"
"09-23","2:11","so then that small door can be any"
"09-23","2:15","um can be any other random port numbers"
"09-23","2:18","it doesn't need to be 80. okay that's"
"09-23","2:20","something you need to pay attention and"
"09-23","2:22","after I type in this command"
"09-23","2:25","you can see it is trying to connect to"
"09-23","2:28","this"
"09-23","2:32","connect to this server okay these are"
"09-23","2:34","all the responses after that okay after"
"09-23","2:37","that after this connection is"
"09-23","2:39","established okay what I what I'm doing"
"09-23","2:42","is I'll send a get message"
"09-23","2:46","I want to get this"
"09-23","2:50","object this is one object"
"09-23","2:52","okay the ATP version is 1.1 that's the"
"09-23","2:57","format I'll get okay a format of this"
"09-23","3:00","request line after that I will specify"
"09-23","3:05","who is the server"
"09-23","3:10","okay I'm providing this guy I don't"
"09-23","3:13","suggest you thought you must have knew"
"09-23","3:14","as the server name okay and this line"
"09-23","3:18","hostline is actually the header line"
"09-23","3:20","okay here you can see in my request"
"09-23","3:23","message I have only one request line"
"09-23","3:28","which is get and one"
"09-23","3:32","headline only two lines in my request"
"09-23","3:35","message okay that's all"
"09-23","3:38","foreign"
"09-23","3:47","after that"
"09-23","3:49","the server will respond okay I'm waiting"
"09-23","3:52","for the server to respond"
"09-23","3:53","so this entire thing"
"09-23","3:58","is the response message"
"09-23","4:07","okay if you look at the first line the"
"09-23","4:11","first line is HTTP 1.1 200 okay as we"
"09-23","4:16","said this is actually the status line"
"09-23","4:19","right the status line and then after"
"09-23","4:22","that you see a number of header lines"
"09-23","4:29","foreign"
"09-23","4:37","you can see the dates of this response"
"09-23","4:40","message date and time and the server for"
"09-23","4:44","the uh for the web server this is Apache"
"09-23","4:47","okay that is the program and it's"
"09-23","4:49","powered by PHP the content length the"
"09-23","4:53","type Etc okay so those are the header"
"09-23","4:56","lines and after that you can see"
"09-23","5:01","this entire thing"
"09-23","5:06","okay"
"09-23","5:09","so this is actually the data part okay"
"09-23","5:12","do you remember"
"09-23","5:14","if you look at here"
"09-23","5:16","we said the data is appended after the"
"09-23","5:19","header lines right so"
"09-23","5:23","this part is the data okay and if you"
"09-23","5:26","look at the data the dog type"
"09-23","5:29","the document type is HTML okay and then"
"09-23","5:35","um you can see uh"
"09-23","5:37","this uh this file HTML file the head the"
"09-23","5:42","title and everything the body okay so if"
"09-23","5:45","you have learned HTML before you know"
"09-23","5:47","this is actually one HTML page right one"
"09-23","5:51","HTML file so basically what is happening"
"09-23","5:56","here is actually I'm making a request to"
"09-23","6:00","the server directly and the server is"
"09-23","6:03","replying with the data it's responding"
"09-23","6:07","with the data the data is just the one"
"09-23","6:11","HTML file okay"
"09-23","6:13","but since we are not using the web"
"09-23","6:16","browser we are not using the web browser"
"09-23","6:19","so this web page is not displayed as a"
"09-23","6:23","web page it's actually just shown as a"
"09-23","6:25","as the raw data okay and the raw data"
"09-23","6:28","the source code uh that's what you see"
"09-23","6:31","okay of course what will happen if"
"09-23","6:34","you're if you are using the web browser"
"09-23","6:37","then the backgrounds will will basically"
"09-23","6:40","pass this part plus this um web page and"
"09-23","6:44","display it in the browser okay question"
"09-23","6:47","so far"
"09-23","6:51","foreign"
"09-23","6:55","so the next part this slide is showing"
"09-23","6:59","you"
"09-23","7:00","um another test okay I'm trying to"
"09-23","7:03","connect to the web browser a web web"
"09-23","7:06","server at sex State okay so you can say"
"09-23","7:12","it's I'm trying to tell that to csus.edu"
"09-23","7:16","at Port 80."
"09-23","7:20","the connection is successful okay I'm"
"09-23","7:22","able to connect directly with that"
"09-23","7:24","server and I also sent"
"09-23","7:27","one get message okay the gas the gut"
"09-23","7:31","request message here is uh I'm trying to"
"09-23","7:35","request for index.html"
"09-23","7:38","okay"
"09-23","7:39","but as you can see as you can see"
"09-23","7:44","the server is replying to me another"
"09-23","7:51","the stat line is is actually full for"
"09-23","7:53","not fund okay what does this mean this"
"09-23","7:57","means on the server side it doesn't have"
"09-23","8:00","any a"
"09-23","8:01","index.html file it cannot find it okay"
"09-23","8:06","so you can see these are all the header"
"09-23","8:08","lines"
"09-23","8:09","and then you can see the data"
"09-23","8:14","okay so although you can the server does"
"09-23","8:18","not have any"
"09-23","8:20","index.html file but it's still providing"
"09-23","8:24","me a web page"
"09-23","8:25","okay it's still providing me a web page"
"09-23","8:28","this web page is just displaying"
"09-23","8:30","actually the four funnel fund message"
"09-23","8:33","okay if you don't trust me if you don't"
"09-23","8:36","trust me you can open your web browser"
"09-23","8:38","type in"
"09-23","8:41","cs.csus.edu"
"09-23","8:43","index.html and you can see what what"
"09-23","8:46","will happen after that okay"
"09-23","8:49","um of course I I did this uh years ago"
"09-23","8:52","so probably the webpage changed is"
"09-23","8:54","possible okay"
"09-23","8:57","all right any questions so far"
"09-23","9:08","okay so I would encourage you to try"
"09-23","9:11","this on your own uh after class okay"
"09-23","9:16","so the next thing we are going to"
"09-23","9:19","discuss is uh about the cookies okay uh"
"09-23","9:24","if you have watched the video on Friday"
"09-23","9:26","you probably have already known we"
"09-23","9:30","mentioned one thing when we learn about"
"09-23","9:32","http"
"09-23","9:33","okay let me see we said"
"09-23","9:37","HTTP is stateless okay status basically"
"09-23","9:42","means the server maintains no"
"09-23","9:44","information about past client request"
"09-23","9:46","okay so what does this mean this means"
"09-23","9:51","um although the client"
"09-23","9:53","sorry uh sorry I you can you can hear"
"09-23","9:57","the noise again so this is this is some"
"09-23","10:00","reminders kind of things it's pop out"
"09-23","10:02","when I'm giving lectures uh hopefully"
"09-23","10:05","you are not these terms by this okay"
"09-23","10:09","um but again so HTTP is stateless"
"09-23","10:13","means the server maintains no"
"09-23","10:15","information about the request the past"
"09-23","10:18","client request although for example I'm"
"09-23","10:20","visiting a website like Amazon okay"
"09-23","10:25","um the lab server will never remember my"
"09-23","10:28","information"
"09-23","10:29","so you may say that's not true"
"09-23","10:31","okay because for example one day I want"
"09-23","10:35","to buy something I put something for"
"09-23","10:38","example I'm buying let's say uh a book"
"09-23","10:41","okay I put in that I put that book into"
"09-23","10:45","the cart okay and I didn't pay for it"
"09-23","10:48","after many days when I come back again I"
"09-23","10:51","can still see that book in my cart"
"09-23","10:54","does this mean the server is remembering"
"09-23","10:56","the information about the request"
"09-23","11:01","this means this means I would say yes"
"09-23","11:05","this means the server is indeed"
"09-23","11:07","remembering information about the client"
"09-23","11:11","request but"
"09-23","11:14","it is not it is not because of HTTP it's"
"09-23","11:18","not it's not because the web server or"
"09-23","11:21","the HTTP session is remembering this"
"09-23","11:24","it's actually because something else"
"09-23","11:26","okay what is that something okay that is"
"09-23","11:30","actually the cookie"
"09-23","11:36","it's called cookies okay how do we use"
"09-23","11:39","cookies"
"09-23","11:40","so a cookie is basically composed of"
"09-23","11:43","four components so firstly"
"09-23","11:47","um"
"09-23","11:49","okay header line of HP response message"
"09-23","11:51","okay"
"09-23","11:54","um and then cooking headline in the next"
"09-23","11:56","request message"
"09-23","11:59","um the third thing is the cookie file"
"09-23","12:01","that is kept on the user's host and the"
"09-23","12:04","last thing is the back end database at"
"09-23","12:06","the website so four components probably"
"09-23","12:08","now now you don't need you don't know"
"09-23","12:10","why do we consider these four components"
"09-23","12:13","and I'll explain this okay I also need"
"09-23","12:15","this let's first look at example in this"
"09-23","12:18","example somebody called Susan"
"09-23","12:22","um always access internet from PC so"
"09-23","12:25","Susan visits specific e-commerce site"
"09-23","12:29","for the first time"
"09-23","12:31","and because this is for the first time"
"09-23","12:33","okay so when this request this initial"
"09-23","12:37","ATP request arrived at the site the site"
"09-23","12:41","will create a unique ID"
"09-23","12:43","okay and store this ID in the backend"
"09-23","12:47","database at the server side so let's"
"09-23","12:49","look at this"
"09-23","12:51","this is the client student"
"09-23","12:53","this is the server okay"
"09-23","12:56","and this is a cookie file this file is"
"09-23","13:00","stored at the web browser it's in the"
"09-23","13:03","web browser okay so when I say clear all"
"09-23","13:06","the cookies in the browser I mean you"
"09-23","13:09","actually clear all the information in"
"09-23","13:10","this cookie file"
"09-23","13:11","okay so now in the cookie file you can"
"09-23","13:14","see we say one cookie"
"09-23","13:16","that is for eBay for this website eBay"
"09-23","13:19","the ID quick ID is eight seven three"
"09-23","13:23","four"
"09-23","13:24","okay"
"09-23","13:26","okay"
"09-23","13:27","um that is the information that is"
"09-23","13:29","already in the cookie file okay but now"
"09-23","13:31","the client is actually visiting Amazon"
"09-23","13:35","another different website"
"09-23","13:37","the client is visiting Amazon"
"09-23","13:40","for the first time"
"09-23","13:42","okay it is sending an HP request"
"09-23","13:45","the server recognized that this client"
"09-23","13:48","is a new user"
"09-23","13:50","okay say hey I got a new customer then"
"09-23","13:54","the server will create an ID for the"
"09-23","13:57","user"
"09-23","13:58","okay the ID is 1678 okay and this ID"
"09-23","14:03","will be stored"
"09-23","14:05","here at the back and database okay one"
"09-23","14:10","six seven eight installed here"
"09-23","14:13","meanwhile the server will respond to"
"09-23","14:16","the client"
"09-23","14:18","in the response message"
"09-23","14:22","in the response message do you still"
"09-23","14:24","remember the format for the response"
"09-23","14:26","message the first line is the stat code"
"09-23","14:28","then you have a number of header lines"
"09-23","14:30","right so here when the server responds"
"09-23","14:34","the server will add one"
"09-23","14:38","more headline that is a set cookie"
"09-23","14:41","and telling the client hey I got a new"
"09-23","14:45","ID for you your ID is 1678 okay and you"
"09-23","14:50","can see then this new ID"
"09-23","14:52","is now stored at the client side"
"09-23","14:55","in the cookie file"
"09-23","14:58","okay then"
"09-23","15:02","the next time when the client contacts"
"09-23","15:05","the server again"
"09-23","15:08","it will make another HPV request right"
"09-23","15:11","if you still remember the format for"
"09-23","15:13","request message we know the first line"
"09-23","15:15","is guess something usually okay and"
"09-23","15:18","second the starting from the second line"
"09-23","15:20","is uh is the headlines right so now we"
"09-23","15:25","will add one more headline"
"09-23","15:29","okay this is the header line one more"
"09-23","15:32","headline in the request message to say"
"09-23","15:34","hey I'm not a new customer I have my"
"09-23","15:38","cookie my cookie ID is one six side"
"09-23","15:41","okay then the server will check"
"09-23","15:46","okay the server after we see this"
"09-23","15:48","request message it will check this ID"
"09-23","15:51","167 is in the backend database and"
"09-23","15:54","recognize oh this is Susan"
"09-23","15:58","okay so then the the server will respond"
"09-23","16:03","will respond uh in a specific way okay"
"09-23","16:06","we'll respond to this to Susan with some"
"09-23","16:10","of our Susan's information loaded in"
"09-23","16:12","advance"
"09-23","16:13","okay so then it will send it back and uh"
"09-23","16:17","HTTP response message"
"09-23","16:20","okay and then and then one week later"
"09-23","16:25","one week later if Susan is contacting"
"09-23","16:29","the server again"
"09-23","16:31","then it will still"
"09-23","16:34","add this cookie"
"09-23","16:36","as long as this cookie is not clear it's"
"09-23","16:38","not inspired then it can still add this"
"09-23","16:42","cookie then the server will check"
"09-23","16:46","this cookie idea again in the background"
"09-23","16:49","database and say oh this is Susan again"
"09-23","16:51","visiting us one week later so then the"
"09-23","16:54","server will load Susan information again"
"09-23","16:58","and respond uh in a specific way okay so"
"09-23","17:02","this is how it works this is the entire"
"09-23","17:04","process"
"09-23","17:05","as you can see in this process it is not"
"09-23","17:09","HTTP"
"09-23","17:12","remembering the information it's not the"
"09-23","17:15","server the web server program"
"09-23","17:17","remembering the information of the"
"09-23","17:19","client it's actually this database"
"09-23","17:23","it's actually this back-end database"
"09-23","17:25","remembering all the information and then"
"09-23","17:28","load this information in the ones that's"
"09-23","17:30","what happens actually okay uh that's why"
"09-23","17:34","usually when you buy things online"
"09-23","17:37","okay we always visit websites online so"
"09-23","17:40","they will say oh okay they are using"
"09-23","17:42","cookies okay this is a this is a very"
"09-23","17:45","convenient for users because your status"
"09-23","17:48","are remembered okay but it also has"
"09-23","17:51","privacy issue as you can see here okay"
"09-23","17:54","also has privacy issue"
"09-23","17:57","and actually one interesting thing is uh"
"09-23","18:00","for example sometimes especially during"
"09-23","18:05","Black Friday when you when you're"
"09-23","18:07","shopping uh for something okay when you"
"09-23","18:10","are shopping when you are"
"09-23","18:12","um getting those kind of deals okay"
"09-23","18:15","sometimes they will they will also use"
"09-23","18:17","cookie okay uh the servers will also use"
"09-23","18:21","cookie they can see one customer can"
"09-23","18:24","only use this coupon for once"
"09-23","18:28","okay for once how do they know you you"
"09-23","18:32","have used this coupon for once or twice"
"09-23","18:33","they use cookie to remember you they"
"09-23","18:36","will say oh okay this customer has"
"09-23","18:38","already used this coupon before so we"
"09-23","18:41","cannot if if he or she buy again we"
"09-23","18:44","cannot give him or her another discount"
"09-23","18:48","okay that's what happens so one way to"
"09-23","18:52","to"
"09-23","18:54","um address this problem is actually you"
"09-23","18:58","can clear the cookies okay if you clear"
"09-23","19:00","the cookies at your side okay the server"
"09-23","19:04","will not be able to recognize your"
"09-23","19:07","machine again so the server will treat"
"09-23","19:09","you as a new customer and then you can"
"09-23","19:11","use the coupon for second time or for"
"09-23","19:14","many times okay that's like a bonus as a"
"09-23","19:18","computer science student okay"
"09-23","19:22","all right uh let me look at the"
"09-23","19:25","uh"
"09-23","19:26","questions in the chat"
"09-23","19:32","one question is since the server is"
"09-23","19:34","storing data in the back-end database is"
"09-23","19:37","this still considered stateless"
"09-23","19:40","uh when we see status I mean HTTP is"
"09-23","19:44","status I I don't mean the server or this"
"09-23","19:49","entire website is stateless okay I mean"
"09-23","19:52","HTTP itself the protocol itself is"
"09-23","19:55","status because the protocol"
"09-23","19:58","never remember the past client uh"
"09-23","20:02","information so for example if you look"
"09-23","20:04","at the HTTP request message and response"
"09-23","20:07","message here okay it doesn't remember"
"09-23","20:10","any of your previous information the"
"09-23","20:13","server the server does not use HTTP to"
"09-23","20:15","remember it is using the backend"
"09-23","20:17","database so I would say"
"09-23","20:20","if we want to make this accurate I would"
"09-23","20:23","say HTTP protocol is stateless"
"09-23","20:27","okay I do not say anything else"
"09-23","20:32","Does this answer a question"
"09-23","20:37","okay good"
"09-23","20:42","another question is is there reasons I"
"09-23","20:45","shouldn't accept cookies on a website"
"09-23","20:49","um some most of the time I think you can"
"09-23","20:52","you can reject you can of course reject"
"09-23","20:55","using cookies on a specific website then"
"09-23","20:58","in this case they will"
"09-23","21:00","um they will not be able to remember you"
"09-23","21:02","but sometimes you know"
"09-23","21:04","um the website is just enforce okay they"
"09-23","21:08","uh enforce to use cookies so in that"
"09-23","21:12","case if you want to continue using this"
"09-23","21:15","website and then you have to you accept"
"09-23","21:17","the cookie the cookie conditions they"
"09-23","21:20","they have specified for you okay"
"09-23","21:24","um but I would say if you have a choice"
"09-23","21:26","you don't have to accept cookies as"
"09-23","21:29","again as I said it is uh very convenient"
"09-23","21:32","using cookies is very convenient but"
"09-23","21:35","it's uh it also remember your status it"
"09-23","21:38","also has privacy issues"
"09-23","21:41","okay"
"09-23","21:43","yeah any other questions"
"09-23","21:51","all right very good okay so let's see"
"09-23","21:54","what cookies can be used for the cookies"
"09-23","21:56","can be used for a number of things for"
"09-23","21:58","example authorization we know sometimes"
"09-23","22:01","if you have logged in to a website okay"
"09-23","22:05","then you don't have to login again and"
"09-23","22:08","again because they have already"
"09-23","22:10","remembered you using the cookies so this"
"09-23","22:13","is a one functionality of cooking of"
"09-23","22:15","course it has security issue right so if"
"09-23","22:17","you do not sign out if they have already"
"09-23","22:20","remembered you then this will of course"
"09-23","22:23","create some security issues"
"09-23","22:27","um the second thing is for sure shopping"
"09-23","22:28","cart and they have used this example the"
"09-23","22:30","third thing is for recommendations"
"09-23","22:31","because they have remember your sets"
"09-23","22:35","they know what you are looking for then"
"09-23","22:37","they can make recommendations based on"
"09-23","22:40","the activities you have already"
"09-23","22:42","conducted before Okay the third thing is"
"09-23","22:45","to remember the user session State this"
"09-23","22:48","is uh this is similar to the"
"09-23","22:50","authorization part okay"
"09-23","22:53","basically they remember your session"
"09-23","22:56","State and then you don't have to uh log"
"09-23","23:00","in again again and also of course"
"09-23","23:02","sometimes they also remember some of the"
"09-23","23:05","settings in the current session okay"
"09-23","23:07","then they do not you do not need to"
"09-23","23:11","restart everything from scratch okay"
"09-23","23:15","so that's uh the functionalities for"
"09-23","23:18","cookies so how can we how to keep the"
"09-23","23:22","state okay basically"
"09-23","23:24","um"
"09-23","23:27","uh basically the protocol endpoints is"
"09-23","23:31","maintaining the state and center and"
"09-23","23:33","receiver side or multiportion sections"
"09-23","23:35","okay the cookies are what used to"
"09-23","23:39","remember the state okay again as I said"
"09-23","23:43","hcp itself is not is stateless it"
"09-23","23:47","doesn't remember any state but the"
"09-23","23:49","cookies are helping the ATP protocol to"
"09-23","23:55","remember the stage okay this is used by"
"09-23","23:59","the server side to remember the clients"
"09-23","24:02","uh States okay so this is different from"
"09-23","24:05","the protocol being staged as itself okay"
"09-23","24:10","um and of course of course you can see"
"09-23","24:13","cookie permits sites to learn a lot"
"09-23","24:14","about you this is a this has a privacy"
"09-23","24:17","concern okay"
"09-23","24:20","um"
"09-23","24:21","so that's something you need to pay"
"09-23","24:23","attention to all right so that's all"
"09-23","24:26","what I want to cover about cookies any"
"09-23","24:28","questions"
"09-23","24:35","okay"
"09-23","24:38","all right"
"09-23","24:40","so the next thing is about web cache so"
"09-23","24:43","webcash is another very important thing"
"09-23","24:45","in uh in the web service uh so what is"
"09-23","24:50","the web cache webcache is also called as"
"09-23","24:52","processor I think you probably heard"
"09-23","24:54","about this term before proxy okay so"
"09-23","24:58","what does this mean"
"09-23","25:00","um proxy is basically one machine"
"09-23","25:03","set between the clients and the original"
"09-23","25:07","servers okay usually it is very close to"
"09-23","25:11","the client"
"09-23","25:13","it's close to the client okay"
"09-23","25:15","so the goal for webcache is to satisfy"
"09-23","25:19","the client request without involving the"
"09-23","25:22","original server"
"09-23","25:24","okay the arranging server"
"09-23","25:26","um so why do we do that you can think"
"09-23","25:29","about this usually usually if you want"
"09-23","25:31","to request something you want to connect"
"09-23","25:34","to the arena server and then the Renault"
"09-23","25:36","server sent back the objects you need"
"09-23","25:39","right but this is not very efficient"
"09-23","25:42","sometimes especially when the servers"
"09-23","25:45","are far away from the clients"
"09-23","25:47","okay"
"09-23","25:49","the response time may be very long okay"
"09-23","25:52","maybe seconds or even minutes"
"09-23","25:54","okay then uh in this case"
"09-23","25:58","if we have a proxy server okay"
"09-23","26:03","if we have proxy server the process"
"09-23","26:05","server can fetch some of the"
"09-26","0:03","okay all right so the next thing is about web cache so"
"09-26","0:11","webcash is another very important thing in in the web service"
"09-26","0:17","so what is the web cache webcache is also called as processor I think you probably heard about this term before"
"09-26","0:23","proxy okay so what does this mean um proxy is basically one machine"
"09-26","0:31","set between the clients and the original servers okay usually it is very close to"
"09-26","0:39","the client it's current close to the client okay so the goal for webcache is to satisfy"
"09-26","0:46","the client request without involving the original server"
"09-26","0:51","okay the arranging server um so why do we do that you can think"
"09-26","0:56","about this usually usually if you want to request something you want to connect to the arena server and then the Renault"
"09-26","1:04","server sent back the objects you need right but this is not very efficient"
"09-26","1:10","sometimes especially when the servers are far away from the clients"
"09-26","1:15","okay the response time may be very long okay maybe seconds or even minutes"
"09-26","1:22","okay then uh in this case if we have a proxy server okay"
"09-26","1:30","if we have proxy server the process server can fetch some of the objects in"
"09-26","1:35","the ones and put it onto this uh local machine this proxy okay then whenever uh"
"09-26","1:43","the so for example if this client is is trying to get this object for the first"
"09-26","1:50","time from this unreading server okay then the client can send a HP request"
"09-26","1:56","to the proxy so let me display this again send it to"
"09-26","2:01","the proxy the proxy will say hey my client is trying to get this object can"
"09-26","2:07","you send it to me then the proxy will contact the original server to to make"
"09-26","2:14","another request right the original server will respond to the proxy"
"09-26","2:19","the proxy then responded to the client okay so you may say why do we do this we"
"09-26","2:24","are adding one more step between the client and the Renault server the benefit of using proxy is actually"
"09-26","2:32","later when other clients are making the"
"09-26","2:37","same request okay requesting for the same website the"
"09-26","2:42","same same object then the client can contact proxy and proxy can respond"
"09-26","2:49","directly without involving the arranging server that is the benefit okay you can"
"09-26","2:56","think about this for our University if we have so many users we may have thousand ten of ten thousand users okay"
"09-26","3:03","on campus then most of us need to request something from let's say Google"
"09-26","3:09","we use some very common websites okay then if everyone is connecting Google"
"09-26","3:17","directly connecting to Google directly you can see that a lot more traffic is"
"09-26","3:23","between us and Google so for each user the response time may be long"
"09-26","3:31","right the response time may be very long and the traffic is a lot okay if we have"
"09-26","3:37","more traffic than the the response time can be even longer okay you can see more delays but if we have a proxy in between"
"09-26","3:45","okay then when the first client is using this uh is requesting something from"
"09-26","3:51","Google then the proxy can get this Google.com webpage on the processor okay"
"09-26","3:57","then later on some other clients are requesting for the same thing they don't need to contact Google anymore it is"
"09-26","4:03","saving a lot of time so pay attention actually the cash here"
"09-26","4:08","acts as both the client and the server okay so when the client is making a"
"09-26","4:15","request the pocket server is now a server but"
"09-26","4:22","when the proc server is making a request to the original server now the processor"
"09-26","4:27","becomes a client okay so it has a two rows both client and zero"
"09-26","4:33","uh and typically the cache is installed by ISP University company or residential"
"09-26","4:39","ISP and typically the cache is close to the clients we mentioned why last time"
"09-26","4:46","right we want this to be close to clients so the response time can be improved can be very short okay"
"09-26","4:53","so here we list several motivations for using"
"09-26","4:59","web cache firstly is to reduce the response time for client requests I"
"09-26","5:04","guess you can all understand this now okay the second one is to reduce the"
"09-26","5:10","traffic on institutions accessing what does this mean"
"09-26","5:15","so um so if these are all the clients okay if"
"09-26","5:22","this is the cash and if this is the original silver"
"09-26","5:32","okay now you you think about this because most of the requests"
"09-26","5:38","are already Satisfied by the cache by the proxy okay we use those two names uh"
"09-26","5:46","interchangeably okay then in this case um"
"09-26","5:52","we do not need to request something from the original"
"09-26","5:57","server I mean most of the time of course there are still time we need to come down to the original server right"
"09-26","6:03","so then the link the link between the cache and the internet"
"09-26","6:09","okay for this we can see this is the entire the entire internet in this internet we have Arduino servers"
"09-26","6:16","right so this link is called the Access Link"
"09-26","6:26","as you can see here we can indeed reduce the traffic on the institutions Access"
"09-26","6:32","Link right why because again most of the requests from the clients are already"
"09-26","6:38","Satisfied by the cash okay that's the main reason any questions"
"09-26","6:47","no okay good so uh the third motivation um"
"09-26","6:53","is that uh now the internet is dense with the caches okay so this enables the"
"09-26","7:01","per content providers to effectively deliver the content so what what is"
"09-26","7:06","content provider content providers means for example uh YouTube is accounting"
"09-26","7:13","provider Netflix is a content provider okay so mostly for those video providers"
"09-26","7:19","they need to provide the content okay so of course we have big companies like"
"09-26","7:26","YouTube like Netflix but we also have smaller companies or smaller content"
"09-26","7:31","providers they may not have the resources at those big companies okay but they still want to deliver the"
"09-26","7:39","content as fast as possible they still want to provide very good experience to"
"09-26","7:44","the customers how can they do this they can use cash okay they can basically push their content to the caches then in"
"09-26","7:53","this case um most again most of other clients requests can be certified as a cash okay"
"09-26","7:59","so this this uh improves their service so those are the three major motivations"
"09-26","8:05","for uh web caching okay um we just mentioned uh especially for"
"09-26","8:13","the first one we mentioned this can web caching can reduce the response time for client requests but some of you may not"
"09-26","8:21","agree with me right how do you know that so then next we want to use this caching"
"09-26","8:27","example to prove why I said that right why and how how this can"
"09-26","8:35","improve the response time okay now uh here you can on the figure uh in this"
"09-26","8:42","figure on the right you can say we have a number of servers okay this is the public internet"
"09-26","8:49","okay and we also have any institutional Network in this institution"
"09-26","8:54","institutional Network we have these clients and um for now for this machine you you it"
"09-26","9:01","can be treated as a normal client or a normal server whatever okay"
"09-26","9:08","um and this router is the access router or we call it add"
"09-26","9:14","router okay and this link is called the Access Link"
"09-26","9:21","okay this actually starting is connected to the public internet and again on the"
"09-26","9:26","public internet we have a number of servers so now we assume the average object size is 100k beats so what does"
"09-26","9:34","this mean this means um we know the clients are making requests from the Arduino server right"
"09-26","9:40","request for what for objects right we assume these servers for example one of"
"09-26","9:45","them is the web server foreign"
"09-26","9:52","object size is 100 KBs okay that means a image is 100k of web"
"09-26","9:59","page is 100k uh PDF is also 100kv average okay we average and then the"
"09-26","10:05","average request rate from the browser to the original server is 15 requests per second"
"09-26","10:20","what does this mean this means the web browser is making 15 requests"
"09-26","10:27","per second okay and each request is requesting for"
"09-26","10:32","one object okay the object is 100k"
"09-26","10:38","okay now we can calculate the average data rate so the hourly data rate is"
"09-26","10:43","100k 100 KBs"
"09-26","10:53","per object times"
"09-26","11:00","foreign"
"09-26","11:07","bits per object times 15 objects per second right so in total this is a"
"09-26","11:24","in total this is 1500 KBS per second that means"
"09-26","11:42","right that means 1.5 megabits per second which is 1.5 Mbps okay BPS stands for"
"09-26","11:51","beats per second okay that's how we get this number"
"09-26","11:57","on the slide okay this is the average degree you may ask why do we calculate that"
"09-26","12:05","the reason is because we want to know here for the Access Link"
"09-26","12:12","you can say it's 1.54 Mbps that means in one second we can send"
"09-26","12:19","1.54 megabits data okay so that is the bandwidth of this Access Link we want to"
"09-26","12:27","know if this Access Link is busy or not right we want to know how much data how"
"09-26","12:35","much data is sent through this Access Link in one second per second okay then"
"09-26","12:41","we kind of sense oh if this is busy or not so then you may ask again why do you care if Access Link is busy or not"
"09-26","12:48","later you will know this is very important for the response time okay"
"09-26","12:54","all right so then let's let's first leave that and then let's look at the rtt from the router to the internet side"
"09-26","13:01","okay the rtt from this router to the original server if this is a"
"09-26","13:10","also a web server okay and then coming back"
"09-26","13:16","pay attention from this router from the router at the internet side from the"
"09-26","13:22","router at the internet side to the original server and then coming back the rtt here we assume is two"
"09-26","13:29","seconds okay all right so now let's calculate the total delay"
"09-26","13:36","the total Delay from a client let's say client a to server"
"09-26","13:42","V okay from A to B we know the total delay should be the"
"09-26","13:49","time let me use a change of color [Music]"
"09-26","13:55","um okay let's let's look at how I draw here"
"09-26","14:01","okay from A to B we are traveling to the first sorry let's chain two different"
"09-26","14:06","colors we are traveling to the first round here okay and then we go through the Access"
"09-26","14:14","Link and then we go to the"
"09-26","14:20","lab server B and we come back and then we come back to the Access Link"
"09-26","14:28","and then the router comes back to here do you say"
"09-26","14:34","this is this is the entire process the total delay should be should consider all those six segments"
"09-26","14:42","okay so now we consider this part"
"09-26","14:52","this part we know it is two seconds"
"09-26","14:58","right the the blue part is two seconds in the internet side okay"
"09-26","15:05","and then now we consider"
"09-26","15:11","we consider this part this um the the local area network part I"
"09-26","15:20","mean the institutional Network part then we consider these two"
"09-26","15:26","what is the total time span here the time spent here is called the land"
"09-26","15:32","delay okay so the land delay as you can see"
"09-26","15:39","it is usually very fast because it's just local right it's usually very very fast"
"09-26","15:46","so the um here the internet delay"
"09-26","15:53","I use the blue color is two seconds okay the land delay we said is very it's"
"09-26","15:59","very fast and then another thing we need to consider is actually the accessioning"
"09-26","16:06","part we only we are only left with this part"
"09-26","16:12","okay so then this part is called the access delay"
"09-26","16:18","how many how much time do we spend here the access delay is determined by how"
"09-26","16:25","busy this Access Link is if this Access Link is is very very busy"
"09-26","16:31","then we will spend a long time there it's like when you drive drive home from"
"09-26","16:36","school if the road is very busy then you you will have a long delay there it's the same thing okay so then now our"
"09-26","16:44","question is is Access Link busy now"
"09-26","16:49","is this busy we just calculated our data rate to the"
"09-26","16:56","browsers right so the average data rate is 1.5 Mbps"
"09-26","17:04","that means the re the data we going through from the institutional Network to the public internet going through the"
"09-26","17:11","Access Link is 1.5 Mbps and the bandwidth here we have is 1.54 Mbps"
"09-26","17:19","you can imagine is this busy of course this is busy right because this is 99"
"09-26","17:26","that means that the bandwidth is already utilized to the four almost right so 99"
"09-26","17:34","means oh this is very busy then we have to spend a very long time there it can"
"09-26","17:41","be minutes for example right usually when minutes is already a"
"09-26","17:46","very long time in uh in networking okay so now you can see the total delay here"
"09-26","17:53","is actually two seconds plus minutes plus microseconds"
"09-26","17:59","then finally it is mostly determined by the access delay by the minutes part"
"09-26","18:05","right okay so now let me ask you a question if you want to improve this situation"
"09-26","18:12","what would you do if we want to improve this situation"
"09-26","18:18","which means if you want to um decrease the delay"
"09-26","18:24","okay then you have to decrease the excess delay right you have to decrease"
"09-26","18:29","it excessively now what would you do okay how about we do this"
"09-26","18:36","we increase the bandwidth from 1.54 MBS Mbps to 154 Mbps that's a huge increase"
"09-26","18:45","right now the Access Link utilization rate becomes"
"09-26","18:51","becomes 1.5 over one point Sorry over 154."
"09-26","18:58","that is 0.99 that is even less than one percent"
"09-26","19:05","so it's not busy anymore right then because it's not busy so the access"
"09-26","19:11","delay can be decreased significantly okay for example it can be decreased"
"09-26","19:17","from minutes to M seconds okay now we know this total delay is"
"09-26","19:22","equal to two seconds plus M seconds plus microseconds so it's about I would say"
"09-26","19:28","it's about two seconds foreign that's a good idea"
"09-26","19:38","but this solution this solution I would say is very expensive"
"09-26","19:43","right you think about this every time when we have a problem like this we have"
"09-26","19:48","to change the cable right success link"
"09-26","19:54","and many times this can be very expensive especially if you consider this if this link is uh uh is across the"
"09-26","20:03","ocean right so how expensive that is okay so um"
"09-26","20:12","apparently that's not the best solution all right so we just mentioned okay we"
"09-26","20:19","can increase the accessing speed to solve this problem but that is not cheap"
"09-26","20:24","okay that's not the best solution okay uh do we have a better way to improve"
"09-26","20:30","the response rate or response time from what we just learned okay you just"
"09-26","20:35","guess do we have a better way so here we have a local web cache We Make This"
"09-26","20:41","Server a local web cache that means every time when a client wants to"
"09-26","20:46","connect with the original server it will need to firstly connected to the Local web cache okay"
"09-26","20:54","and ask the cash hey do you have this object or not okay then in this case we"
"09-26","21:01","still we still view the average of size as a 100K beats okay and we still view"
"09-26","21:08","the average uh request rate as 15 requests per second and the average data"
"09-26","21:14","rate to browser is 1.5 Mbps so the calculation is still the same the round"
"09-26","21:19","trip time on the internet side is still two seconds and the access link is still 1.5 Mac bks we do not change anything"
"09-26","21:27","okay now we assume the line and the learn side that utilization rate is still 15"
"09-26","21:33","which means the land side is not busy okay it's not busy so the land side is"
"09-26","21:38","still very fast now we need to calculate the total delay"
"09-26","21:44","so again before we we want to calculate the total delay we need to the total delay now still include includes the"
"09-26","21:52","third 3.3 portion okay uh the land portion the access portion and also the internet"
"09-26","21:59","portion okay but how do we calculate the link utilization rate"
"09-26","22:04","here how do you calculate the utilization rate do we still use 1.5 M BPS no"
"09-26","22:14","why because a lot of requests have already been certified by the web cache"
"09-26","22:21","The Local web cache they do not need to go through this Access Link okay"
"09-26","22:27","so then here we want to we want to make some assumptions before we we make the"
"09-26","22:33","Assumption we cannot do any calculation okay we assume the cash credit rate is 0.4"
"09-26","22:41","what does this mean what is cash flow rate we know the cash cannot hold everything"
"09-26","22:48","right the cash only holds the most ly uh common uh visited websites"
"09-26","22:56","okay then now we assume 40 percent of the request"
"09-26","23:04","40 percent of the clients request can be certified as a cash"
"09-26","23:10","okay that means when you request for a web page 40 percent like the likely hold"
"09-26","23:16","of getting certified by the cash is just forty percent okay and the sixty percent"
"09-26","23:21","requests need to be certified as a regional server okay so what does this mean this means"
"09-26","23:28","do you remember the Access Link arrange knowledge need to carry 1.5 Mbps"
"09-26","23:36","right originally and now how much data need to go through here"
"09-26","23:46","how much did I need to go through here originally 1.5 Mbps has to go through"
"09-26","23:55","this Access Link okay is it 60 of that right accident so"
"09-26","24:01","it's 60 percent of the 1.5 Mbps okay that means it's a 0.9 Mbps"
"09-26","24:14","only 0.9 BPS need to go through the success link the other 40 percent"
"09-26","24:21","are already satisfied at the local cash okay does this make sense"
"09-26","24:30","so now we want to know because this is only 0.9 is this accessing still busy"
"09-26","24:38","it's not busy anymore right it's not busy let's say okay"
"09-26","24:45","um so as I calculate it's 0.9 Mbps and now the utilization rate for the Access"
"09-26","24:51","Link is 0.9 overall 1.54 so it's just a 58 percent"
"09-26","25:00","okay 58 percent means it's not congested so now the accessing is not congested so"
"09-26","25:09","it's also very fast okay then now the question is"
"09-26","25:15","how can we calculate the total delay okay"
"09-26","25:21","so if we want to calculate the total delay we want to average for for some requests some requests can be certified"
"09-26","25:27","here by the cache and some requests have to go through"
"09-26","25:33","the access link to the public internet so as you can see some requests can be certified very quickly and some cannot"
"09-26","25:40","okay it's like when we want then how can we calculate the average"
"09-26","25:47","it's like if we have for example um let's say if we have"
"09-26","25:53","um the grace for each student the grid for each student for the final exam okay if"
"09-26","25:59","I want to calculate the Outreach what can I do some students have got zero"
"09-26","26:05","that's brutal I know right some students get 100 okay"
"09-26","26:11","let's say we have 40 students 40 person students get zero and a 60"
"09-26","26:19","person student get 100 how would you calculate the average"
"09-26","26:26","zero times 40 percent plus 100 times 60 percent"
"09-26","26:35","right that's how you calculate the Outreach of our students right if you don't trust me some of you"
"09-26","26:42","may say oh 40 means zero times 40 students"
"09-26","26:47","plus 100 times 60 students"
"09-26","26:52","now in total we have 100 students that is the average"
"09-26","27:00","right some of you made me say that because this is the same thing I would zero time 40 plus 100 times 60 okay"
"09-26","27:08","that's how we calculate the average okay it's the same thing for the total"
"09-26","27:14","delay okay let's see the total delay now equals to"
"09-26","27:20","60 percent how to be satisfied by the original"
"09-26","27:26","server that means 60 times the delay from original server"
"09-26","27:32","plus 40 percent can be certified as a cash so that is 40 percent times the"
"09-26","27:39","delay when certified at the cash okay so that is sixty percent times what time"
"09-26","27:48","what is the delay from original server so then this one have to go through here"
"09-26","27:55","Local web cache we know it's very fast and Access Link is now very fast"
"09-26","28:02","and then it has to go to the public internet we know this is two seconds"
"09-26","28:09","right two seconds Plus maybe M seconds plus microseconds in"
"09-26","28:16","total we can see it's about 2.01 a little bit more than two seconds"
"09-26","28:24","right so that is for those requests that have to be certified at the server Arena"
"09-26","28:30","server okay and for the remaining for the remaining uh delay the remaining uh"
"09-26","28:38","requests they have they can be certified at the local web cache and I may know the local"
"09-26","28:44","um web local area network is not busy right so then the delay is very very"
"09-26","28:53","shocked so that is about 0.01 seconds"
"09-26","28:58","okay so in total if you calculate then this the total delay is"
"09-26","29:06","about about 1.2 seconds"
"09-26","29:12","1.2 seconds that's that is our delay"
"09-26","29:18","and if you compare this number with the one before"
"09-26","29:27","do you see this the one before is about two seconds a little bit more than two seconds right when we increase the"
"09-26","29:34","bandwidth okay 1.2 seconds is even much better than two"
"09-26","29:41","seconds right so but you can compare the cost the cost"
"09-26","29:49","of in changing the Access Link and the cost of adding one Local web"
"09-26","29:55","cache apparently the second option installing a local web cache is much more cheaper"
"09-26","30:03","than changing the Access Link then increasing the bandwidth of the Access"
"09-26","30:08","Link right so now we know okay with this very"
"09-26","30:14","smart solution we actually we we improved the performance"
"09-26","30:19","but we spend less okay we spend less it's it's a much more"
"09-26","30:24","cost effective okay because the Local web cache is just a a general computer"
"09-26","30:30","it's very uh very early very cheap to to install okay any questions"
"09-26","30:39","I know this is a lot of information on the calculation uh but I think I think"
"09-26","30:44","you you are able to digest this okay and for the exam do not worry for the"
"09-26","30:50","exam I will not ask you to calculate the total delay do the calculation like this you only need to remember the the"
"09-26","30:58","takeaway message the takeaway message is that installing a local web cache"
"09-26","31:05","can improve the response delay or the round trip time"
"09-26","31:11","much better but with with the less uh spans okay less expense"
"09-26","31:19","uh less cost okay so um the next thing I want to talk"
"09-26","31:25","about is about conditional get when we use the cache there is actually"
"09-26","31:31","one problem I I'm not sure if you have noticed this so a problem is"
"09-26","31:37","um the cache you can see the hatred"
"09-26","31:43","the cash flow rate is 40 right and also sometimes the cash"
"09-26","31:49","May store some Auto outdated uh web pages"
"09-26","31:55","or objects does this make sense so some some of the some of the objects have already been"
"09-26","32:01","updated at the original servers but the local cache does not know that"
"09-26","32:07","okay then in this case the objects stored on the local cache is outdated"
"09-26","32:12","Okay this may create a problem for the for the uh clients because the client wants to get the most up-to-date version"
"09-26","32:21","okay in this case how do we address this problem okay we address this problem"
"09-26","32:26","using something called conditional get do you remember that last time we learned the get method"
"09-26","32:32","right for ATP request um so the goal of conditional guide"
"09-26","32:39","basically means the proxy server the cache the processor"
"09-26","32:45","role will contact the original server and say hey can you send me the most up-to-date"
"09-26","32:52","version if my current version is already the most up-to-date one then you don't need"
"09-26","32:59","to send me the object but if it's not the most current version then you need to send me the up-to-date"
"09-26","33:07","version does this make sense okay so then that means the server need"
"09-26","33:14","to check if the current version is the up-to-date one or not"
"09-26","33:20","okay how do we know that how do we know if this is uh"
"09-26","33:26","the most current one or not do you have a question Michael okay okay"
"09-26","33:32","so there do you remember in when we talk about the get message there is one line"
"09-26","33:38","called if modified things okay if you cannot remember that let's"
"09-26","33:44","go back to the get message"
"09-26","33:50","the guide message here"
"09-26","33:56","um let's see it's not here it's in the response message"
"09-26","34:02","yes either sorry sorry I said something wrong in the response"
"09-26","34:07","message we have some headline called last modified okay and I told you this is very"
"09-26","34:13","important right so this tells you the last modified data and time of the"
"09-26","34:18","object how it tells you oh okay this file was"
"09-26","34:24","last modified on October 30th 2007. okay"
"09-26","34:29","and then in the conditional gut okay"
"09-26","34:35","we will use this modified let's modify date and time okay we will say okay if"
"09-26","34:42","this is modified since that date please send me the new version if it's not"
"09-26","34:48","modified then you don't need to send me a new word okay so let's see how it's used"
"09-26","34:54","this is the cache and this is the server okay the cash will send a"
"09-26","35:00","a message Say Hey I want to get a web page or something or some object okay"
"09-26","35:07","and also in this request message we will say if it's modified since this date"
"09-26","35:14","if the object is not modified sorry it's not before it's after"
"09-26","35:22","if it's not modified after that date then the third of your simplicity"
"09-26","35:29","304 not modified what does this mean 304 is the status code right this means the"
"09-26","35:35","object was not modified since that date but if we have"
"09-26","35:41","the object was modified okay then the server will send back 200 okay and"
"09-26","35:49","then attach the data the data is the most"
"09-26","35:54","current version object is the up to date"
"09-26","36:05","okay is the new object this is how it works okay let's see another example"
"09-26","36:11","here we have a conditional uh get so we have one uh sorry we have one cache and"
"09-26","36:19","one server okay the cash will say hey can I get this fruit"
"09-26","36:24","KV dot GIF the HTTP version is 1.1 the host Hospital name is the first outcome"
"09-26","36:32","so this is a fruit stock count okay and then the silver will say okay"
"09-26","36:39","HTTP 200 okay I have this uh object to you I give you this KV and the last"
"09-26","36:47","modified date and time for the KV is September 9th 2017-15 okay so this"
"09-26","36:54","contains the KV okay and then a week later"
"09-26","37:00","the cash will say hey I'm requesting for the Kiwi but"
"09-26","37:06","I already have a version of KV the last mode if I didn't have time is actually"
"09-26","37:12","last one September 9th 2015. if the object is not"
"09-26","37:18","modified so the third of your simply respond back with"
"09-26","37:25","304 not modified and here the amp The Entity body is"
"09-26","37:30","empty because it's not modified so we do not need to update okay"
"09-26","37:36","but you can imagine if this object is modified then what is the response message the"
"09-26","37:44","first line would be what can you guess"
"09-26","37:49","if the object is already modified the first line of the response passage should be"
"09-26","37:55","http 1.1 200 okay"
"09-26","38:01","do you remember you remember here if it's already modified"
"09-26","38:08","then we need to respond with 200 okay and then send in the most up-to-date"
"09-26","38:13","version of the object okay so that's why here in this example pay attention if"
"09-26","38:19","the object is already modified then you will send it back with 200 okay"
"09-26","38:24","here will be HTTP 200 okay"
"09-26","38:29","okay the first line and here you will also need to send in the most up-to-date version of KV"
"09-26","38:37","okay it is clear"
"09-26","38:42","when it says modified does this that's its main object"
"09-26","38:48","yes when we say modified we mean the object is unmodified or not okay I mean the if the web page is"
"09-26","38:55","already updated or not okay yeah this will be on the test"
"09-26","39:07","I want you to remember every sentence here and in the test I may for example I make"
"09-26","39:13","it give you all the host name uh ATP version and everything I want you to"
"09-26","39:20","specify how will you respond okay so for example how would you"
"09-26","39:26","respond here I may also ask you to identify the request message how do you write"
"09-26","39:34","this request message so remember everything here okay"
"09-28","0:04","all right so for socket programming assignments uh we will talk about two"
"09-28","0:10","two different directions one is with UDP the other ones with TCP through uh 2.01"
"09-28","0:17","and 2.2 we have already learned that at the transport layer there are two type"
"09-28","0:22","of protocols UDP and TCP the difference between them is UDP is unreliable and"
"09-28","0:28","TCP is reliable that is one major difference that as a developer as a"
"09-28","0:34","program developer you can choose which protocol to use when you are developing"
"09-28","0:41","your application so if you choose UDP that means you do not care too much"
"09-28","0:46","about reliability you can tolerate a little bit of data loss for example maybe for the video application you can"
"09-28","0:52","allow data loss okay because we if we lose some pixels it's fine we can still watch"
"09-28","1:00","the video like smoothly but if you are developing like"
"09-28","1:06","um a web service then you have to use TCP because this if it's reliable you"
"09-28","1:11","cannot afford losing even one detail data okay that's the major difference so today I will basically show you how to"
"09-28","1:18","do the soccer programming in the socket programming in the in this"
"09-28","1:23","case our goal is to learn how to build client and server applications that"
"09-28","1:29","communicate using sockets okay we know there are two different architectures"
"09-28","1:36","P2P and client server model right so so now we are focusing on client server"
"09-28","1:41","model but it's fine if you do P2P it's the same thing okay anyway these applications will communicate using"
"09-28","1:48","sockets if you cannot remember sockets anymore let me help record what we've learned before so the"
"09-28","1:56","circuit is like a door between application layer and the transporter"
"09-28","2:02","layer okay so basically the application layer have a num have some processes and"
"09-28","2:08","they want to communicate okay for example now we have process a and process B so process is like a"
"09-28","2:16","running application right so you can think this as like an email application"
"09-28","2:22","or a web application okay so anyway when they are when they code"
"09-28","2:30","our application are moved to memory to run then we call it a process okay so"
"09-28","2:36","now the computer to computer communication is actually a process to process"
"09-28","2:43","communication okay driving process a wants to send a message to process B it"
"09-28","2:51","needs to push this message through a door okay that door is called socket do you"
"09-28","2:58","still remember the analogy I gave you before if you want to use the Postal Service then basically you need to"
"09-28","3:05","prepare a package and put that package outside the window right so now in this"
"09-28","3:11","case your door is like the socket then after you push your package outside of"
"09-28","3:17","your door somebody from the postal office will come to pick up your package"
"09-28","3:23","and then deliver it for you so it's like this message is picked up at the transport layer and then delay word for"
"09-28","3:30","you to the other transporter layer at the other side okay at that destination"
"09-28","3:36","then basically process B can"
"09-28","3:42","come to pick up this package okay come pick up this message through a socket"
"09-28","3:48","again okay so that is the socket then in this case you are using the services"
"09-28","3:56","provided by the internet okay so what you really need to do"
"09-28","4:02","when you are doing the development is you call some apis okay you call some"
"09-28","4:10","interfaces so then you can directly directly use the services you don't have"
"09-28","4:16","to write all the code from scratch so that's something you need to keep in mind okay now let's look at this uh"
"09-28","4:26","this application so for this application"
"09-28","4:31","basically uh it has a very simple functions firstly the client reads a"
"09-28","4:38","line of characters from its keyboard and sends the data to the server you"
"09-28","4:44","imagine you imagine now you have a client machine and a server machine so this can this one can be a client this"
"09-28","4:51","one can be a server okay so the client reads a line of characters from its"
"09-28","4:56","keyboard and sends the data to the server the server receives the data and"
"09-28","5:02","converts the characters to uppercase then the server sends the modified data"
"09-28","5:09","back to the client finally the client receives the modified data and displaced this line on its"
"09-28","5:16","screen so that is the application very simple very simple so basically the main idea"
"09-28","5:22","is oh the client wants to convert the lowercase characters into"
"09-28","5:28","uppercase that's all okay the server is providing just one service that is"
"09-28","5:34","converting the characters to uppercase that's all okay so of course if we think"
"09-28","5:40","about the web service the other services the service may be much more complicated"
"09-28","5:46","but here we just use the one very simple very straightforward to"
"09-28","5:52","demonstrate how the client server model can be deployed or can be implemented"
"09-28","5:58","using socket programming before I demonstrate the code okay I"
"09-28","6:03","want to firstly discuss at high level what will happen Okay so if you are"
"09-28","6:09","doing circuit programming with UDP you need to pay attention for UDP we do not"
"09-28","6:14","need to do any handshaking kind of thing between the kind of server so we do not need to establish any connection between"
"09-28","6:21","the client server before we do that exchange okay then in this case the center if the sender wants to send"
"09-28","6:28","something to the server the sender can ex need to explicitly attach the IP"
"09-28","6:36","destination address and port number to each packet so it's like"
"09-28","6:42","there is no established connection between you and your friend if you want to write a letter to a friend you need"
"09-28","6:49","to explicitly write down the address and the name of your friend on the envelope"
"09-28","6:55","okay so it's like that then the receiver side will extract this Android IP address and phone number from the"
"09-28","7:02","received package and then reply back okay so like when your friend receives your letter your friend will read the"
"09-28","7:10","information on the envelope including your name and your address and then"
"09-28","7:15","extract this this name and address and then reply to the same name the same address okay so that is the UDP"
"09-28","7:23","pay attention for UDP the transmitted data may be lost or received out of order okay from application point of"
"09-28","7:31","view UDP provides unreliable transfer of groups of bytes between the client and"
"09-28","7:39","server so that is UDP and I want to skip this part because later"
"09-28","7:45","I'll show you in the code so if you are doing programming with the"
"09-28","7:51","TCP pay attention for TCP we must establish a connection first"
"09-28","7:58","okay that means that means it's like if you want to mail a letter to your"
"09-28","8:04","friends okay you can imagine there is a huge pipe between you and your friends"
"09-28","8:10","okay a pipe you need to be firstly established and then what you do is you"
"09-28","8:16","just drop your letter to that pipe okay then the letter will automatically"
"09-28","8:21","goes to your friends okay in this case you don't need to specify the"
"09-28","8:27","destination IP address and destination port number because I mean the pipe is"
"09-28","8:33","already established with that destination um address and definition name okay so"
"09-28","8:40","this is like the for TCP so in this case the client must contact the server"
"09-28","8:47","the server process must first be running okay the first server must have created"
"09-28","8:52","the socket that welcomes the client's contact this is the same for both"
"09-28","8:58","UDP and TCP um then the client will need to firstly"
"09-28","9:05","contact the server by creating a TCP socket specifying the IP address phone number of server process okay"
"09-28","9:13","when the client creates the socket the client TCP established connection to the server TCP so you can see this is"
"09-28","9:20","basically the pipe part okay the establishing the pipe part is leveraging"
"09-28","9:26","the connection okay then when contacted by the client the server TCP creates a"
"09-28","9:32","new socket for the server program process to communicate with the"
"09-28","9:37","particular client so I will explain this later probably you are already overwhelmed right now and that's totally"
"09-28","9:44","fine okay that's 225 but anyway from the application point of view okay TCP is"
"09-28","9:52","providing the reliable in all the byte stream transfer between the client and"
"09-28","9:57","the server okay so I I'm gonna stop here uh in the"
"09-28","10:03","slides and I want to give you a demo right now I'm trying to open the"
"09-28","10:10","terminal and in the terminal so I currently you can see my my code I actually put on the"
"09-28","10:16","desktop I'm using a Mac uh if you are using Linux machine okay you will you"
"09-28","10:22","can do the same thing basically you can deploy your code on your local machine okay or if you are able to connect to"
"09-28","10:28","Athena you can also do the coding on Athena directly something you need to"
"09-28","10:33","pay attention is for this for this exercise because um the scanning code provided by the"
"09-28","10:40","textbook is using python 2 so please make sure you are using python 2. you"
"09-28","10:48","should install python to do not install Python 3 because otherwise you will run into some problems okay or if you are"
"09-28","10:56","confident that you can solve the problems those are very minor issues you can solve those issues that's fine but"
"09-28","11:02","if you are not confident please please use the python too okay here"
"09-28","11:08","um I'm just going to direct to"
"09-28","11:13","to my desktop python okay you can see here I have two photos TCP and UDP now"
"09-28","11:21","we can go to TC we can do UDP first it's easier okay"
"09-28","11:27","so in this folder I have two two pieces code client.py and 0.py you can ignore"
"09-28","11:34","the other one with the sharp sign okay um so usually when you firstly start"
"09-28","11:40","programming you have not nothing right you need to firstly create a new file on your own okay here I've already"
"09-28","11:46","created my file so I'm I'm good but if you have nothing there yet you need to"
"09-28","11:53","create a file so what you can do is you can do for example touch new DOT qy okay"
"09-28","11:59","then you can see here is the new file you can create it then you can do the"
"09-28","12:06","um editing new py okay then you can do the do the editing"
"09-28","12:12","so you can see see um do the program in socket whatever okay"
"09-28","12:18","do the programming here but um here I don't want to do the pro"
"09-28","12:24","programming Lively I'll just show you the code okay foreign"
"09-28","12:31","I don't want to keep it here you remove it and then now let me firstly run a server"
"09-28","12:38","program okay so pay attention you always need to run the server program now I"
"09-28","12:44","just want to give you a sense what what this feel like so and then later I I'll"
"09-28","12:51","show you the code okay so let me firstly run the server if the server is not there yet the client"
"09-28","12:57","when the client can't have the server the server is not there so the client will definitely fail so run the server"
"09-28","13:04","first by using python server.py you can see the server is ready to"
"09-28","13:09","receive and now you need to start a new window okay new window because this one is"
"09-28","13:17","already running the server I need another one to run the client okay so do the same thing"
"09-28","13:23","where are you stop the code"
"09-28","13:28","DP okay and then I run the client"
"09-28","13:35","okay you can see the client just giving me a proper message to say input the lower case sentence okay you can say I"
"09-28","13:43","like computer science okay and then it will return I like"
"09-28","13:50","computer science in uppercase that's all that's how the code works"
"09-28","13:57","okay so the for TCP and UDP is the same thing okay for TCP and UDP is the same thing"
"09-28","14:04","exactly the same functionality but they are deployed using"
"09-28","14:09","um different protocol as transport layer so why is using UDP and otherwise using TCP okay so now I want to show you the"
"09-28","14:17","code so let me show you the code"
"09-28","14:26","[Music] um let's see The Client First"
"09-28","14:34","okay so this is the client code this is the client-side code"
"09-28","14:43","okay so at the client side you can see firstly what we need to do"
"09-28","14:49","is do from socket import asteroid so this means this means you"
"09-28","14:55","want to import the library for uh for socket okay then after that because the"
"09-28","15:00","library is imported so you can directly use some of the functions in this Library okay then the server name server"
"09-28","15:09","name equals to 127.0.0.1 pay attention here because I put my"
"09-28","15:17","server and client on the same machine on the same machine so here the IP"
"09-28","15:23","address is actually the local the local machine okay this is"
"09-28","15:28","127.0.0.1 is for local machine if you are using F Athena so for example"
"09-28","15:35","if you put your client as on your local machine and you put your server on"
"09-28","15:40","Athena then here the server name should be Athena's IP address or Athena's name"
"09-28","15:46","so for example you can put athena.ecs.csus.edu here or you can put"
"09-28","15:52","an IP address of Athena here okay so pay attention to that that is"
"09-28","15:58","very important on the slides on the slide here the server name is type at"
"09-28","16:04","equal to hostname so some students when they do the programming they follow the"
"09-28","16:09","slides and then they directly type everything here they directly typing uh"
"09-28","16:15","hostname equal to hostname but what is host name you didn't really specifies host name right"
"09-28","16:22","um the we do not have any machine called hostname so then that's why their code"
"09-28","16:27","didn't work and then the email me say hey professor I cannot figure out what why this code doesn't work it's actually"
"09-28","16:34","because of this so pay special attention to the server name"
"09-28","16:39","and then the second the second line is some report equal to one two zero zero one here what I'm"
"09-28","16:48","using is one two zero one that means I'm contacting the server"
"09-28","16:54","at Port 12001 that means the server needs to listen to this port"
"09-28","17:00","okay you can use any you can use other ports you don't need to use one two zero"
"09-28","17:05","zero one this is just a random phone number so pay attention uh for this one"
"09-28","17:11","you can Google online what are the port numbers available it's usually from one to sixty five thousand uh"
"09-28","17:20","536 I I'm not sure if this is accurate but try to avoid those famous port"
"09-28","17:27","number like 80 like 25 okay because those ones are reserved okay so you"
"09-28","17:34","cannot use those ones that's the second thing you need to pay attention and then client stock is equal to socket AF"
"09-28","17:42","Internet stock D gram here this means we are calling a function called socket"
"09-28","17:49","and this socket we are this function will help us create a new"
"09-28","17:54","socket like a door okay it is using address family internet which means"
"09-28","18:01","using the IP address and the sock D program uh sorry soccer diagram circuit"
"09-28","18:07","gram here means we are using UDP that is"
"09-28","18:12","very important that is where you slash it specify you use UDP okay"
"09-28","18:18","so after you create this then this is like uh this is a socket is created and"
"09-28","18:24","so we later we can refer to this socket as client socket okay after that then we"
"09-28","18:33","we create another variable called message message equal to Raw input"
"09-28","18:38","this is a function called also okay this function code will give a proper message so the prop"
"09-28","18:46","message here is called the input lowercase sentence you can type in anything else you can type Place type in"
"09-28","18:53","your sentence or anything any prop message you like okay and after that it will also collect the"
"09-28","19:00","keyboard input and put this input into the message"
"09-28","19:06","okay so then now the message has your keyboard input after that what we do is we use this"
"09-28","19:14","client socket okay do you remember we already established this client socket we use"
"09-28","19:20","this one and call it some function called send two okay pay attention here we need"
"09-28","19:29","to use send to not send okay I explain why so in this set of two function first"
"09-28","19:34","you need to attach the message and then later you will need to"
"09-28","19:39","uh give the server name and server Port so we know server name is IP address so"
"09-28","19:45","report is the port number do remember I said before"
"09-28","19:50","because we are using UDP there is no connection established yet so that's why"
"09-28","19:56","you have to you have to explicitly specify the server name and"
"09-28","20:03","the server port or the destination IP address and that's important so this is how you do that okay after that you just"
"09-28","20:11","wait okay so here you can say uh we will call another function call called"
"09-28","20:16","receive from so you will just receive from the server okay so here 20 48 is"
"09-28","20:24","the buffer size okay it's the buffer size and then after you receive the"
"09-28","20:29","message the response message from the server you will extract that message and"
"09-28","20:35","get two wearables one is a two pieces of"
"09-28","20:41","information basically one piece of information is the modified message which means the message is already sent"
"09-28","20:47","to the server the server has already converted it to uppercase and then send"
"09-28","20:53","it back so now you can you can put that message into the modified message this is the variable name and also there is a"
"09-28","21:01","second piece of information contained in this uh data you received so the second piece of information is the server's"
"09-28","21:08","address the service address so you will put it into server address"
"09-28","21:14","because actually here you already know the service address before right you specify the server name so you do not"
"09-28","21:20","really need this right now but still when you want to put it into some variable okay and then after that you"
"09-28","21:27","print the modified message and then you close the socket okay you close please"
"09-28","21:33","pay attention after this is all things are done you need to close the client"
"09-28","21:40","socket that is very important okay because otherwise this socket will be"
"09-28","21:46","open okay always open and it will basically waste the resource of the client side"
"09-28","21:53","and also the server side okay so this is uh the client code client"
"09-28","22:00","code and um let me show you the server code"
"09-28","22:20","so this part is the server code okay this is the server code so firstly at"
"09-28","22:27","the server side the server side you also need to do socket from socket import import the Sim library and pay attention"
"09-28","22:35","here you can see the server port number is exactly the same as the one we"
"09-28","22:42","specified in the client so usually what we need to do actually is you firstly specify the one in server and then use"
"09-28","22:50","the same one in the client that's usually uh the order okay then the"
"09-28","22:55","server side need need to also create a new socket by using socket function and"
"09-28","23:01","here we can see it is also using UDP if you use UDP and client sign then you"
"09-28","23:06","need to use it at the server side okay then later we need to bind bind This"
"09-28","23:12","Server uh Port 12001 okay with this socket so then the"
"09-28","23:19","server socket will uh the several will be always listen to this port at one two"
"09-28","23:25","zero zero one okay and then after that the server is ready the server will say hey I will print a message to say hey"
"09-28","23:32","the server is ready to receive okay and then after that do remember we learn"
"09-28","23:37","when we learn client server model we said the server will have to be always on right so the server will run a while"
"09-28","23:44","loop forever never stop okay so in this while loop you can see it"
"09-28","23:51","will firstly do receive from it doesn't do any send it to yet okay because the"
"09-28","23:57","server is waiting to be contacted so the server will do receive from"
"09-28","24:03","using the server socket and the buffer is still 2048"
"09-28","24:08","it will extract two pieces of information again the same thing as here as here in the client side"
"09-28","24:14","okay do you remember okay so here the two pieces of information is firstly it"
"09-28","24:22","extracted the message received okay secondly it will extract the address of"
"09-28","24:29","the client okay because it is contacted by the client but it doesn't know the IP"
"09-28","24:35","address of the client IP address port number so that's why actually this"
"09-28","24:41","socket will will extract the client address and then later reply to this"
"09-28","24:46","same address okay then after that after that it will call"
"09-28","24:53","another function call called upper it will basically convert this message into our practice and then store it into"
"09-28","25:01","a new variable called modified message after that as you can imagine the server"
"09-28","25:07","circuit will basically call another function called section 2. so Senator we used this before right in the client"
"09-28","25:14","code so it will send to what send to"
"09-28","25:19","send it to the client address okay send it to the client address"
"09-28","25:25","send what send the message send the modified message okay here you can do"
"09-28","25:31","the encoding or you can just send modify the message that's also fine but please"
"09-28","25:36","remember if you do encoding here then you're like in the at the client side you also need to do the uh decoding when"
"09-28","25:43","you receive it but it's a it's a fine so this part is you have the flexibility okay"
"09-28","25:50","so that is the client and server code for t for UDP okay so let me"
"09-28","25:58","wait"
"09-28","26:03","let me show you the code of TCP TCP is a little bit different so let's"
"09-28","26:09","see the um aligned first okay so this is the client"
"09-28","26:16","code for TCP we have only eight minutes left so I want to make this faster so firstly"
"09-28","26:24","firstly you can say we need to import the socket and we"
"09-28","26:30","specify the server names report we create a new socket called a client"
"09-28","26:36","socket it's the same but there is one thing you pay attention here"
"09-28","26:41","it's using stock stream not sock D gram"
"09-28","26:47","sockscream means we are using TCP that's how you choose okay then later after"
"09-28","26:54","that it's very important this is very important later when you firstly"
"09-28","26:59","establish a connection with the server okay do remember in UDP we do not need"
"09-28","27:06","to do this but in TCP we firstly need to establish a connection with the server"
"09-28","27:13","the server name is this one the support is this one and then it will call Raw"
"09-28","27:18","input okay give this prop message take the input and put it into something called"
"09-28","27:24","sentence okay later the client socket will call function called send not send"
"09-28","27:32","to incent function we only need to drop the"
"09-28","27:37","sentence there the message there we do not need to specify the destination IP"
"09-28","27:43","destination Port the reason is because a pipe is already established between the"
"09-28","27:49","sender and the receiver we do not need to explicitly specify the name the other the address"
"09-28","27:56","definition address and destination Port that's the reason pay attention to this this is very important"
"09-28","28:02","and then later we will do receive the client socket will do the receive"
"09-28","28:07","message and then do the decoding okay so finally print from server the"
"09-28","28:16","modified sentence so basically the received message is put into the modify"
"09-28","28:21","sentence and then we'll print out this uppercase sentence after that the client"
"09-28","28:27","socket will close okay so pay attention here in the client socket really close"
"09-28","28:33","but in the server socket do you remember in this for example even for UDP even"
"09-28","28:38","for UDP the server socket Network loads because because"
"09-28","28:44","the server should be always on it will be there forever okay so that is a TCP"
"09-28","28:53","and then let's uh"
"09-28","28:58","see the server code foreign"
"09-28","29:11","okay so this is uh the TCP code the TCP server side"
"09-28","29:17","same thing import socket specify the server IP address and then create a"
"09-28","29:24","server size socket using sock stream because this is a TCP okay and then find"
"09-28","29:31","the cell reports with this socket to listen to this portfolio ever then do"
"09-28","29:37","the listening and then we do print this is ready okay so after that it will"
"09-28","29:43","enter a while loop and pay special attention this part is very important"
"09-28","29:48","in the while loop we can see the server circuits okay is accept"
"09-28","29:55","incoming requests so after the accept"
"09-28","30:01","it will do two things the first thing the first thing is it"
"09-28","30:07","will extract the address of the client side and put it into address"
"09-28","30:12","okay and also it will need to create another socket"
"09-28","30:18","called connection call socket okay so what does this mean"
"09-28","30:24","this is a this is very interesting so TCP is different from UDP in UDP we"
"09-28","30:31","have only one server socket that is called the server socket that server socket is uh welcoming the incoming"
"09-28","30:38","message and then also do the service right particip is different TCP have two"
"09-28","30:45","types of server socket so this one the server socket is the one for welcoming"
"09-28","30:52","it's like when you go to a bank somebody is standing there welcoming you so that"
"09-28","30:57","is the server socket but that person that person will not do the real"
"09-28","31:02","business with you that person will not serve you directly instead that person"
"09-28","31:07","will assign you to some uh teller sitting behind the window and say hey"
"09-28","31:15","please help this uh this this person um he or she is one wants to withdraw"
"09-28","31:22","some money right and then the person sitting behind the window is doing the"
"09-28","31:27","work or doing the service for you so that person is this connection socket"
"09-28","31:32","okay that means in TCP TCP can receive can welcome a number of incoming"
"09-28","31:39","requests okay and enough a number of incoming clients and extract their address and then assign that request"
"09-28","31:47","choose a new socket called connection socket this connection socket will do"
"09-28","31:53","the service for for you okay so that's why you can see later this connection socket is not the server socket it's the"
"09-28","32:00","connection socket receive the message and put it into something called sentence and then convert this sentence"
"09-28","32:07","into uppercase put it into capitalize sentence and then later send this capitalized"
"09-28","32:13","sentence to the client and again you can see it's using send not to send the tube"
"09-28","32:18","because as we said a connection is already established between the server"
"09-28","32:24","and the client what we need to do is we only drop the message we don't need to specify the destination IP address and"
"09-28","32:31","destination Port okay and then after that interestingly you can see the"
"09-28","32:38","connection socket need to be closed after everything is done we need to"
"09-28","32:43","connect the close the connection socket that means what that means when you go to the bank you talk to the person who"
"09-28","32:51","sits behind the window and that person after he finished the service to you he"
"09-28","32:56","or she can leave okay they can leave to take a rest they don't have to be there forever"
"09-28","33:02","but the person who stands in front of the door the welcoming person can never leave"
"09-28","33:09","because he or she will be there forever to welcome the newcomer new new"
"09-28","33:15","customers it's the same thing here you can see we close the connection socket but we never"
"09-28","33:22","close the server socket that's the difference okay never close the server"
"09-28","33:27","socket so in the test I may ask you the question how many types of socket server"
"09-28","33:35","sockets do you need to create in TCP you know we need to create at least two types let me ask you how many do we need"
"09-28","33:42","to create how many types do we need to create in UDP they you know in UDP you"
"09-28","33:48","only need to create one type okay I may also ask you um do you need to climb close the client"
"09-28","33:56","socket you should know yes we need to close the client socket do you need to"
"09-28","34:02","close the server socket you never close the server socket which is welcoming"
"09-28","34:07","right but you can close the connection socket the one which is doing the real"
"09-28","34:12","service for you in TCP okay so those are all the things you need to understand if"
"09-28","34:18","you understand this this very basic principles you will know the answer to those questions okay"
"09-30","0:02","foreign it talks about the major application of"
"09-30","0:10","email and basically we will discuss some of the protocols like smgp pop through"
"09-30","0:17","IMAP and we will show you how the email works okay some of you may think oh okay"
"09-30","0:24","when I send an email to somebody else then the email is going from my computer"
"09-30","0:32","directly to the other computer is this true that is not true okay that is not"
"09-30","0:38","correct actually there are something in between between your computer and the"
"09-30","0:44","other computer okay so let's see what is happening what is the entire process for sending email firstly for email you"
"09-30","0:51","should know there are three major components you have user agent user agent means"
"09-30","0:58","those um mail also known as a mail reader okay so for example Outlook maybe the user"
"09-30","1:06","agent the iPhone mail client may be the user agent the user agent is the one you used to read emails compose emails send"
"09-30","1:15","emails Etc okay so that is the software or the application you use to do those"
"09-30","1:24","kind of composing editing reading things okay so that is the user agent that is a"
"09-30","1:29","one very important component this one this user agent is similar to"
"09-30","1:35","the wire of to the web browser in web service okay and then the second"
"09-30","1:43","component is mail server so mail server are the ones to help you send email out"
"09-30","1:51","and the mail service will exchange emails later I will show you the entire process then you will know how the mail"
"09-30","1:58","server work okay so basically on mail server on each meal server you can see"
"09-30","2:04","there is a outgoing message queue and also a user mailbox"
"09-30","2:10","okay so the ongoing message queue is basically a queue"
"09-30","2:16","coding all the outgoing emails so those emails may all be sent out one by one"
"09-30","2:22","okay and then the user email box is uh is just like your mailbox at home right"
"09-30","2:30","so so the poster Postman will send those mails into the mailbox so you use those"
"09-30","2:38","user mailbox to receive mails okay so to receive emails usually each account has"
"09-30","2:46","a one mailbox okay so then those mail server will assign the emails to each"
"09-30","2:54","user okay so that is the two things with the email server okay"
"09-30","3:00","and again those are just machines okay user agents is on a computer and mail"
"09-30","3:06","server is just a one machine um in addition to those we also need"
"09-30","3:11","some protocol to help them understand each other okay the protocol we use is"
"09-30","3:18","called simple mail transfer protocol okay so those are the three major"
"09-30","3:26","components for email and now let's look at"
"09-30","3:32","now let's look at the mail server okay the mail server as I mentioned contains"
"09-30","3:39","the mailbox a message queue okay and also it will implement the SMTP"
"09-30","3:46","protocol so the mailbox basically contains the incoming messages for user the message"
"09-30","3:52","queue will have outgoing messages okay the SMTP protocol is between the"
"09-30","4:01","mail servers okay or sometimes between the user agent and the mail server okay"
"09-30","4:07","so basically in this SMTP protocol we also have client and server client is"
"09-30","4:14","the one sending mail out okay and the server is the one receiving the mails"
"09-30","4:21","okay so that's how we classify the clients and servers"
"09-30","4:27","then for SMTP for SMTP SMTP is a protocol and application layer"
"09-30","4:35","if you still remember the five layer"
"09-30","4:51","okay if you still remember to have five layers we have application here transport layer Network layer data link"
"09-30","4:57","layer and also the physical layer so add application layer we know we learned the protocol step right we said for each"
"09-30","5:05","layer we need some protocols okay for application layer if if you still if you"
"09-30","5:12","recall what we have learned in the web service okay application layer the web"
"09-30","5:17","service is using HTTP do you remember"
"09-30","5:22","and transportally as we said it will use usually it will use TCP because TCP is"
"09-30","5:28","reliable right so that is for web service then how about for email"
"09-30","5:37","for email pay attention the application layer is using SMTP"
"09-30","5:48","of course later we will learn there are actually some more protocols for example popular IMAP they"
"09-30","5:56","are all the protocols used for email but here the most commonly used one is SMTP let's discuss this first okay"
"09-30","6:02","application layer we can use SMTP and then transport layer"
"09-30","6:08","what kind of protocol should we use should we use TCP or UDP"
"09-30","6:15","the answer is a TCP why because TCP is"
"09-30","6:21","reliable for email service of course we cannot afford losing data right so that's why we are"
"09-30","6:28","using TCP okay all right and also based on what we have learned"
"09-30","6:35","from the sake programming assignment we know those applications will when they are"
"09-30","6:41","um communicating they are the Motions are actually listening to a port right"
"09-30","6:46","so for example the server we are listening to a port and the client will also use a port to connect with the"
"09-30","6:53","server so then for web service we know the port used is 80. that means the server is listening to"
"09-30","7:00","Port 80 okay of course we do not limit the port used by the client the client"
"09-30","7:06","can use like a random Port okay but server will always web server will always listen to Quality"
"09-30","7:12","for email is similar okay the email server will always listen to Port 25."
"09-30","7:22","okay 425 the client client can use other phone numbers that"
"09-30","7:28","is also fine okay and uh for SMTP it's using direct"
"09-30","7:34","transfer which means if the SMTP is used between two servers okay two servers"
"09-30","7:40","then the sending server will communicate directly with the receiving server okay and also there are three phases of"
"09-30","7:47","transfer the first phase because it is using TCP"
"09-30","7:52","okay so firstly we know if you it is using TCP it must establish a connection"
"09-30","7:58","first okay before the data exchange they must firstly establish a connection the"
"09-30","8:04","connection is like establish a pipe between these two machines okay so that"
"09-30","8:09","is the handshaking's phase so this is a four"
"09-30","8:18","foreign okay handshake is used to establish TCP"
"09-30","8:25","connection after the connection is established then they can transfer messages they can exchange the messages"
"09-30","8:32","okay finally after everything is done we will close this uh connection okay so"
"09-30","8:39","those are the three phases of transfer and then for the interaction uh basically they will use commands and"
"09-30","8:47","response all those commands and responses are in Oscar code so it's it's a it can be understood by human being"
"09-30","8:54","okay it's just like HTTP do you remember in HTTP we have the request message"
"09-30","8:59","which contains get Etc okay and we also have the response message which contains the status code"
"09-30","9:06","and all those phrases it's similar for SMTP is the same thing we will have"
"09-30","9:12","requests or commands and then we will have response from the server so the"
"09-30","9:18","server will respond with some status code and also phrase explain explaining the status code okay uh those are all"
"09-30","9:26","the information you need to know now let's look at an example this example will show you how the email is"
"09-30","9:34","really so how this how the process is for for"
"09-30","9:40","the email okay so firstly we have a center Alice"
"09-30","9:47","and we also have a receiver robot okay"
"09-30","9:52","now we are just looking at one way okay Alice is sending a message to Bob"
"09-30","9:57","so the first step Alex will need to use the user agent"
"09-30","10:03","to compose a message to Bob at some school.edu"
"09-30","10:08","okay and then Alice is a user agent will send this message to her mail server"
"09-30","10:15","the message is placed in the message queue so basically"
"09-30","10:21","this message is put here in the message queue"
"09-30","10:27","then the client side of SMTP which means client-side which means here because"
"09-30","10:33","Alice is sending right so that means L is email server is the client side so Alice mail server"
"09-30","10:41","will need to open a TCP connection with Bob's mail server"
"09-30","10:46","okay and say hey can I connect with you I have something for you okay and Bob's"
"09-30","10:52","mail server say sure let's connect and then they establish a connection after that after that the SMTP client which is"
"09-30","11:01","the analysis mail server we all sent the message over this TCP"
"09-30","11:07","connection and put it into the mailbox for Bob"
"09-30","11:17","so this can be Bob's mailbox okay So eventually eventually Bob will invoke"
"09-30","11:26","his user agent which can be outlooked for example to read the message okay"
"09-30","11:31","probably I'll see hey do I have any messages that the mail server girl say"
"09-30","11:36","yes there is one incoming message to you okay this is sent to Bob that is the"
"09-30","11:42","entire process okay here in this process"
"09-30","11:48","the Alice may use SMTP"
"09-30","11:53","to connect to Alice's mail server and Bob"
"09-30","11:58","Bob's mail server and Alice mail server may also connect with each other using"
"09-30","12:04","SMTP okay the protocol used between"
"09-30","12:09","Alice melson and Bob's Master is also SMTP the protocol between both male"
"09-30","12:15","server and Bob's user agents um is not SMTP we'll we will explain"
"09-30","12:20","this later why okay so currently you need to know okay SMTP is you can be"
"09-30","12:26","used between LS user agent and lsnl server and also"
"09-30","12:32","um Alice's mail server and Bob's mail sir okay so those are the"
"09-30","12:39","things you need to know first now let's look at the SMP interaction okay pay attention this is SMTP"
"09-30","12:48","interaction which means this can happen between"
"09-30","12:53","Alice user agent and Alice's may also work or between Alice email server and"
"09-30","13:01","Bob's mail server okay so this is an SMTP protocol this"
"09-30","13:06","can be used between two machines okay so now let's look at the uh the entire"
"09-30","13:14","introduction okay so firstly s represents server"
"09-30","13:21","C represent light"
"09-30","13:28","okay the server person is saying 220 hamburg.edu this is like a"
"09-30","13:36","self-introduction or the 220 is the response code and it is introducing"
"09-30","13:42","itself say hey I'm hamburger.edu okay the client will say hello to be polite"
"09-30","13:49","right say hello this is uh Crips Dot from so it is basically introduced it itself"
"09-30","13:56","the client is introduced himself okay and then those server will reply with"
"09-30","14:02","250 again this is the status quo so the server girl say hello pretty stuff from"
"09-30","14:09","pleased to meet you okay then the client will say hey I have"
"09-30","14:14","one mail okay this mail is from"
"09-30","14:20","Alice at prep stuff run okay and pay attention pay attention here"
"09-30","14:25","hello h-e-l-o and mail from are all commands they are commands used for SMTP"
"09-30","14:33","Direction it's just like the get in the web service in the HTTP request"
"09-30","14:41","message okay this this is something you cannot change so some of you may think oh there's a typo in hello no this is"
"09-30","14:49","how we write it okay hello it's hel it's not h-e-l-l okay"
"09-30","14:54","and then after that the server say um okay let me check the sender's email"
"09-30","15:02","address Alice at crypto from seems okay so it sends it says the sender is fine"
"09-30","15:07","okay sender okay then the client will say okay let me"
"09-30","15:12","tell you who is the recipient who is the receiver so this receiving email address"
"09-30","15:19","should be Bob at hamburger.edu so rcpt 2"
"09-30","15:24","receipt 2 is is another command telling the receiving email address okay then"
"09-30","15:33","the server reply with 250 Bob hamburger.edu resume okay so basically"
"09-30","15:39","it's checking the receiver's email address and see everything is fine after that after that the client will say data"
"09-30","15:47","so what does this mean this is another command data means I'm"
"09-30","15:53","ready to input the data the data for the message okay then the server will say"
"09-30","15:59","please enter your your mail okay and the mail with a DOT or a period on"
"09-30","16:07","the line by itself okay so that means what that means okay you can start enter the email"
"09-30","16:13","but how do I know um which is the end of your"
"09-30","16:19","email right so you can denote the end of email with a single period online by the"
"09-30","16:25","by itself then the client will say okay let me type in the data okay data is"
"09-30","16:42","okay this is the message content data is do you like catch up"
"09-30","16:48","how about pickups okay that's that is the message content after that"
"09-30","16:54","it use one single Dot or one period on a"
"09-30","17:01","line by itself to denote this is the end of the message"
"09-30","17:12","okay so then the server can see okay the message is accepted for delivery"
"09-30","17:19","then the client say okay I'm done so client can quit the server will say"
"09-30","17:26","221 hamburg.edu Closing Connection so this means okay this entire session stuff okay usually here if the client"
"09-30","17:35","has another mail okay if the client has another male then"
"09-30","17:40","client will directly say mail from again here"
"09-30","17:50","received two data so it can continue before it quits"
"09-30","17:56","okay if it has another email for that mail server if nothing else then it just"
"09-30","18:02","quit um so you can see uh this can be this can it can continue for more than one"
"09-30","18:09","email okay so this is the entire process okay we you can actually try this at"
"09-30","18:16","home okay you can try to talk to a email server"
"09-30","18:23","um so let me give you a demo right now so in this demo I'm going to give you a"
"09-30","18:30","demo in this demo okay I'm talking to a server directly so the"
"09-30","18:36","server is"
"09-30","18:44","this is the receiving server as you can see here um"
"09-30","18:49","smtp.csus.edu I'm going to talk to this server directly okay"
"09-30","18:55","and when I'm talking to this server directly foreign"
"09-30","19:05","here to connect to that server directly"
"09-30","19:11","with telnet"
"09-30","19:17","okay with the telnet and and here as you can see I bypass"
"09-30","19:25","this entire thing I bypass the client user agents and also"
"09-30","19:31","the client mail server okay that means I don't want to go through the"
"09-30","19:37","authentication because if you are using uh the user agent at the center side you"
"09-30","19:43","have to firstly log into something right and then talk to the mail server Alice"
"09-30","19:48","Sanders mail server okay and then the center may also revealed talk to receive resume server but here in the demo I"
"09-30","19:56","want to show you I can actually bypass the sender's mail server and directly"
"09-30","20:02","talk to the receivers mail server to send a message to the receiver"
"09-30","20:08","okay and then I can show you um I can indeed receive a message okay"
"09-30","20:15","in my email address in my Xiao y a n dot"
"09-30","20:20","dot sign in your email address okay that is the content for the demonstration let"
"09-30","20:25","me show you that okay so this is my terminal this is my"
"09-30","20:31","mailbox currently I have one just one email there now I want to demo you"
"09-30","20:37","the process okay let me tell nuts"
"09-30","20:43","to SMTP"
"09-30","20:53","and pay attention pay attention I have already used the VPN to connect back to campus network if you do not connect"
"09-30","21:00","back to campus Network currently it does not the campus network will block you it does"
"09-30","21:06","not allow you to talk to the server directly I believe this is a full security reason okay"
"09-30","21:11","and now I'm trying to talk to smtp.csus.edu at 25"
"09-30","21:18","yes you can use Global protect to connect okay and then you can see I'm now connected"
"09-30","21:27","to that machine okay to that machine so what I can do next to remember the first"
"09-30","21:32","uh you can see firstly it says 220"
"09-30","21:38","smtp.sexlink.csus.edu this is the self introduction this is the 220 hamburger.edu part so it is introducing"
"09-30","21:45","self it says okay the real name for me is actually"
"09-30","21:50","smtp.stacklink.csus.edu okay so then the next thing I need to do is I need to be"
"09-30","21:58","um polite I say hello this is gmail.com I pretend to be gmail.com as you can"
"09-30","22:04","pretend to be something else okay I pretend to be gmail.com"
"09-30","22:10","and this hello I'm using capital letter but actually you can use lowercase it doesn't matter okay but I just want to"
"09-30","22:16","distinguish the commands with the other uh information here and you can see the server is seen hello"
"09-30","22:23","back okay let's see hello back and then I say mail from I have a mail from"
"09-30","22:36","x-i-a-o-y-a-n20060 gmail.com this is my personal email address okay"
"09-30","22:43","pay attention I didn't sign into gmail.com I'm just pretending I'm I'm this in this"
"09-30","22:50","Gmail address but I didn't really sign into Gmail and then the sender said that the server"
"09-30","22:58","respond with Center Okay so and he said it's okay then I can see receipt to I"
"09-30","23:06","want to send an email to xiaoyan Dawson at csus.tvu"
"09-30","23:12","okay and then it checks the recipient email"
"09-30","23:18","address and say this is okay the next thing I'm gonna do is say okay I have"
"09-30","23:24","some I'm ready to input data okay then the server say okay start the"
"09-30","23:29","email in the mail input end with uh this single Dot"
"09-30","23:35","on one line by itself so then I began to type in my"
"09-30","23:40","data subject test okay"
"09-30","23:46","this is just a test message okay"
"09-30","23:53","okay and you can see it is cute for delivery"
"09-30","23:58","okay I want to check my email address and see if I receive that sometimes because this"
"09-30","24:04","is sent this is sent through uh it's not directly through the uh"
"09-30","24:11","original way it may goes to like junk you see this"
"09-30","24:18","okay this is actually the junk mail"
"09-30","24:23","this is the meal I received okay so and this close recipient but you can see"
"09-30","24:29","this is the test this is just a test message okay so I can delete this"
"09-30","24:35","if you have other emails you can directly continue say mail"
"09-30","24:40","from ah let's say"
"09-30","24:51","about what whatever.org okay"
"09-30","24:57","and then you can do receipt two"
"09-30","25:08","okay and then you can see I'm ready to input data"
"09-30","25:14","I can see subject mutation"
"09-30","25:23","okay foreign"
"09-30","25:32","house"
"09-30","25:43","okay then we'll end this message it is cute for delivery again"
"09-30","25:53","not sure if comes in see you can see each other"
"09-30","26:00","as you can see this email is also received okay although it's marked at"
"09-30","26:06","junk okay but you can see I can indeed directly talk to the mail to the mail"
"09-30","26:13","server exact state dot edu okay so the reason is marked as"
"09-30","26:18","junk is because my user agent is actually deploying some"
"09-30","26:23","of the filtering mechanism to filter those messages that are suspicious okay"
"09-30","26:31","so that is what I want to demo as we mentioned here it is directly"
"09-30","26:38","connecting to the receiver's mail server it didn't go through the demo in a demo"
"09-30","26:44","we didn't go through the sender's mail server that means we didn't do any authentication okay that will create a"
"09-30","26:52","security problem as you can see just now I can I can use Biden's mail server I"
"09-30","26:58","can so find those email address I can use anybody email address I can use your"
"09-30","27:03","professor's email mail email address or your friend email address or anybody"
"09-30","27:09","else email address so you can pretend to be anybody that is called emails booking okay email"
"09-30","27:17","supporting when you can pretend to be anybody then you can do a lot of bad things for example you can include a"
"09-30","27:25","link in that email and say hey you need to change your"
"09-30","27:31","password asking you to connect click on that link"
"09-30","27:37","and to change the password but actually that link may be a phishing website"
"09-30","27:44","okay it may direct you to some fake website for example to your"
"09-30","27:51","bank to chase.com and then you type in your username password then they"
"09-30","27:56","directly connect collected connect collect your username and password then they can use your username and password"
"09-30","28:03","later to sign into your bank account and withdraw the money okay so you can imagine what kind of"
"09-30","28:09","things can happen that's why in my class I always tell my students"
"09-30","28:15","when you receive an email from somebody no matter how how much you trust this"
"09-30","28:22","person or you trust this email address do not directly click on that link provided in"
"09-30","28:30","the email okay try to type the link on your own"
"09-30","28:35","okay type the URL on your own in the web browser and then click the use the the"
"09-30","28:41","then and you can change the password what do do something else okay"
"09-30","28:46","because you never know you never know they may just provide like for Amazon for example amazon.com they can see"
"09-30","28:53","Amazon um a.com you you may not notice this one"
"09-30","28:58","actual letter in that okay but it may direct you to some fishing website and"
"09-30","29:03","sometimes this link may direct you to download some children horse onto your"
"09-30","29:08","machine okay that's also possible so pay attention to that that is a One Secured"
"09-30","29:13","challenge actually okay um so here in this uh this is this is a"
"09-30","29:20","screenshot basically shows shows you the entire process we have just demoed if"
"09-30","29:26","you are interested you can do this on your own okay you can see if you can receive the email and this is what I did"
"09-30","29:34","you can use any fake email address it doesn't need to be legitimate email address okay but if it is a legitimate"
"09-30","29:41","email address then um it can be useful for email spoofing okay"
"09-30","29:46","some final words about SMTP SMTP use persistent connection do you"
"09-30","29:54","still remember the persistent HTTP and non-person hdp when we talk about the"
"09-30","29:59","web service right persistent GTP allows you to send"
"09-30","30:05","multiple objects in one connection okay"
"09-30","30:11","um and non-president HTTP does not allow you to do that you you can only send a one object in one connection"
"09-30","30:18","okay so as MTP is using Precision connection that's why as you can see in"
"09-30","30:24","the demo I can send two emails in one TCP connection and after that I can"
"09-30","30:30","close the connection right so SMTP requires the message to be asked we all"
"09-30","30:36","know that and we know that it also uses a single period to determine the end of"
"09-30","30:42","message okay so if you compare this with HTTP HTTP is using a pony protocol SM is"
"09-30","30:51","used in printing protocol which means foreign"
"09-30","31:03","from the server okay and smtpu is a pushing protocol which"
"09-30","31:08","means it's actually the silver pushing uh oh sorry it's actually"
"09-30","31:15","um the the client side is pushing the mail to the server side okay as you can see"
"09-30","31:22","here you can see here Alice is our user agent is pushing to at"
"09-30","31:29","least mail server and my Alice mail server is pushing to Bob's mail server"
"09-30","31:34","so these are all pushing that's why we call SMTP is a pushing protocol for web service basically the"
"09-30","31:42","final Firefox the client will poor or request a web page from the server"
"09-30","31:49","it's different direction okay so pay attention to that in the test I may ask you is HTTP a cooling protocol pushing"
"09-30","31:57","protocol okay and they both have the Oscar command and"
"09-30","32:04","response interaction the stats codes okay uh in HTTP each object is encapsulating its own response message"
"09-30","32:10","and the SMTP multiple objects can be sent in multiple"
"09-30","32:17","multipart messages okay and this is the message format you may"
"09-30","32:22","have the header and body we know the header lines are usually true from and"
"09-30","32:28","subject okay a position these are different from the commands these are different from"
"09-30","32:35","the mail from 360 commands Okay these are just the header lines showing the message okay the body is in Oscar code"
"09-30","32:43","ask the characters okay so that is uh that is the"
"09-30","32:49","um SMTP and pay attention as we said"
"09-30","32:55","this is a pushing protocol this is a pushing protocol but between these two can we push"
"09-30","33:03","we cannot okay between these two we cannot push the reason is because"
"09-30","33:09","when we push we will need to make sure the other side is always on okay for"
"09-30","33:16","example when Alice is pushing this Sandra's mail server is always on"
"09-30","33:22","so that's why he she can push and when cellular muscle is pushing the"
"09-30","33:27","receiver's mail server is always on that's why she can push this machine can push okay but when"
"09-30","33:39","when the receiver's mail server wants to push a message to the user agent can we"
"09-30","33:44","push we cannot because the user agent may not be always on"
"09-30","33:49","it may be off if it's off then the receiver's mail server has to try again again and again it's a list of resource"
"09-30","33:56","it's like if the person Personnel is trying to deliver a package for you and you need to sign"
"09-30","34:02","Okay then if you are not at home then they have to try again again so apparently that's not a good idea a"
"09-30","34:09","better idea is okay do not push let's pull so how do we pull"
"09-30","34:15","it's basically the user agents will connect with the mail server"
"09-30","34:23","and ask do I have any messages when this user agent is on it will ask do I have"
"09-30","34:29","any messages that if yes then the receivers may also will give send this"
"09-30","34:35","message to the user agent okay that's the reason why we cannot use SMTP"
"09-30","34:45","because SMTP is a pushing protocol so we cannot use pushing protocol between these two we cannot use a push in"
"09-30","34:53","protocol between the receiver's mail server and the receiver's user agent"
"09-30","34:58","okay then you may answer them what can I use pay attention you can see between these"
"09-30","35:05","two between the centers your region the center smell server we can use sntp because this may Observer Alice's email"
"09-30","35:13","server is always on so you can push okay and then between these two we can"
"09-30","35:19","also use SMTP because the Bob's email server is is always on that's why you can push"
"09-30","35:24","okay here we cannot push because the"
"09-30","35:30","client may not be there okay we don't want to try again again again then here what we can use between the"
"09-30","35:37","receivers mail server and the receivers user agent um is something called mail access"
"09-30","35:43","protocols so male access protocols basically means the user the receiver's user agent can"
"09-30","35:54","check with the receiver's mail server and ask hey do I have do you have a email for me okay if there is a email"
"09-30","36:02","for the receiver then the the mail server receivers may also will send this"
"09-30","36:07","email to the user agent okay um so there are several different types"
"09-30","36:13","of male access protocols okay the first one pop"
"09-30","36:19","full name is post office protocol emergency forward second type is called"
"09-30","36:25","internet mail access protocol IMAP okay this is a very commonly used right map"
"09-30","36:31","is a very commonly used the third type is the one Rams Dimension http okay we"
"09-30","36:37","can use HTTP why because HTTP is a pulling protocol so let's look at each"
"09-30","36:43","one for pop okay for pop through we may have authentication uh sorry"
"09-30","36:49","authorization phase in authorization phase basically what we do is to"
"09-30","36:54","authorize authenticate the user and authorize it okay so for example the"
"09-30","37:00","server will say Okay server is ready okay and then the clientele will say okay my username is Bob the server check"
"09-30","37:07","it say okay and client will say the password is hungry"
"09-30","37:13","okay uh then let's check again say okay that's the the username and"
"09-30","37:18","password are correct and then uh the user can successfully log on okay and"
"09-30","37:24","the transaction phase um the the user"
"09-30","37:29","and this around the client will basically check the content of the email okay so firstly the client can say list"
"09-30","37:35","okay means could you please list the emails for me okay then the server will"
"09-30","37:40","reply with 1 4 98 2 9 1 9 12. so those"
"09-30","37:46","are the emails that are available to this user and then with a single period this"
"09-30","37:52","denotes the end of the list after that the client will say oh you filled the email one place okay then"
"09-30","37:59","third reversing in a mess with one content with a single period as the end of this message so this client can say"
"09-30","38:07","okay delete one okay then clients will see it then we'll shoot you uh here the server will send"
"09-30","38:16","in the message to content okay with a single period Then client will say"
"09-30","38:21","delayed to line us equate and then the server say okay so this is the entire"
"09-30","38:27","process then in this process we can see uh how the client is authenticated and"
"09-30","38:33","how um uh emails are retrieved by the client"
"09-30","38:39","okay so this is the pop third uh for popular what what we just look at is actually"
"09-30","38:47","called the download and delete mode download and delete means uh we download"
"09-30","38:52","the email to the user agent and we delete this from the server as you can see here it's"
"09-30","39:00","deleted from the server so in this case if you want to change the client and you"
"09-30","39:06","want to retrieve the message again you cannot because of the the messages are already deleted from the server okay and"
"09-30","39:13","property can also enable a second Mode called download and okay found that cap"
"09-30","39:18","means we download the message okay and we also keep these messages still on the"
"09-30","39:25","server on the email server then in this case if you change it to a different client for example you change to a from"
"09-30","39:33","your phone to your laptop or whatever you change the different clients then you are still able to download and"
"09-30","39:40","access those emails because they are still there okay and pay attention"
"09-30","39:45","popular is stateless stateless means it doesn't remember"
"09-30","39:51","the status of the previous client requests okay so it's stateless"
"09-30","40:00","then for IMAP IMAP is much more complicated okay"
"09-30","40:06","so basically for IMAP it will keep all the messages in one place and the server"
"09-30","40:12","side okay and this aligns allows the user to organize the messages in folders"
"09-30","40:18","and also very interestingly IMAP is uh is not a stateless protocol it actually"
"09-30","40:25","remembers the user State across different sessions okay that means for"
"09-30","40:30","example we all know if you're using succeed emails sometimes you create a"
"09-30","40:36","new folder for organization right in the in the uh in Outlook or in the in the"
"09-30","40:44","web page directly then in this case in this case um if you log off the next time when you"
"09-30","40:52","log in again the folder that's still there okay that's because IMAP is used as the retrieving protocol okay and this"
"09-30","41:01","also permits a user agent to obtain the comp components of the messages"
"09-30","41:06","okay so that is the IMAP uh now uh the last thing let's look at is the"
"09-30","41:13","web-based email okay um some of you may say oh I didn't use"
"09-30","41:19","any user agent I just use a web browser for example I use email uh Gmail for"
"09-30","41:26","example okay then in this case what you use is actually the protocol between your client and your mail server is"
"09-30","41:35","actually the http okay for example may use Gmail web-based"
"09-30","41:41","Gmail this is using HTTP to send message out and also you are using HTTP to to"
"09-30","41:50","retrieve to retrieve the emails okay that is it that is the um"
"09-30","41:57","web-based email but between the servers between the servers pay attention you"
"09-30","42:02","are still using SMTP okay you cannot use HTTP because there"
"09-30","42:08","are email servers did not run web service clients so let's summarize what kind of"
"09-30","42:14","protocols can be used between the centers user agent and the centers may"
"09-30","42:20","also between the century muscle around the receiver's mail server and also between the receiver's email server and"
"09-30","42:26","the receiver to digits so water can be used what can be used between the"
"09-30","42:32","sender's user agent senders mail server SMTP"
"09-30","42:38","okay so can we use anything else here nothing else right we cannot use"
"09-30","42:45","anything else we cannot of course we cannot use use pop or IMAP right because those are just for male access to"
"09-30","42:52","retrieve the emails it's not worth any emails okay okay now look at the senders mail server"
"09-30","42:59","and the sender a receiver with mail server between them what kind of protocols can we use only SMTP can we"
"09-30","43:07","use anything else HTTP pop IMAP no okay"
"09-30","43:12","so how about we turn the receiver email server and the receiver's user agent"
"09-30","43:18","in addition to http we can also use pop"
"09-30","43:24","and IMAP so this will be a test problem"
"09-30","43:30","I will ask you in a test I will ask you what kind of protocols can be used"
"09-30","43:35","between for example the sender's user agent and senders muscle"
"09-30","43:40","okay so I may say oh I can use HTTP between the sender's mail server and the"
"09-30","43:46","receivers mess over is this correct or wrong all right okay so that's everything"
"09-30","43:54","about email we are continue to talk about"
"10-03","0:02","the the next very interesting topic which is uh DNS the name name service"
"10-03","0:10","okay so we all know that uh as a person we"
"10-03","0:15","have many identifiers we have for example we have the um SSN"
"10-03","0:21","okay we have the name and we have also password numbers okay"
"10-03","0:28","um then for um computers computers also have some name called IP address you can use you"
"10-03","0:34","you can view this uh as a type of identifier right IP address and the"
"10-03","0:42","computers also have names like yahoo.com google.com Okay those names are commonly"
"10-03","0:50","used by humans so you may ask why do we have the names if we have IP address why"
"10-03","0:56","do we need the the host names so it's like we know each person's SSN"
"10-03","1:03","why do we still need a name for for that person if we know Michael's SSN is one two"
"10-03","1:10","three four five okay why do we need a Michael the name Michael for for him"
"10-03","1:17","it's very easy to remember Michael but it's very hard to remember Michael's assassin right we have to use IP address"
"10-03","1:23","for roughly and everything but we also need uh easily understandable"
"10-03","1:30","name for that host okay because you can you can remember yahoo.com you can remember google.com"
"10-03","1:37","it's very easy to type in but it's not easy to remember the 32-bit IP address"
"10-03","1:44","okay then the question is the question now becomes how can we map between the"
"10-03","1:51","IP address and the hostname otherwise it wasn't the answer is called the mean"
"10-03","1:57","name system okay so we need something called domain name system to remember"
"10-03","2:03","the mapping between IP address and name okay actually actually when we mentioned"
"10-03","2:09","DNS it implies two things one thing is a distributed database that means in this"
"10-03","2:16","database we need to store the mappings between IP address"
"10-03","2:21","and the name okay this is this distribute database is actually"
"10-03","2:26","implemented in the hierarchy of many name servers okay but DNS also has"
"10-03","2:33","another menu that means um the application layer for Toko this"
"10-03","2:39","allowed the house to query the distributed database okay so this is another thing we are"
"10-03","2:45","going to learn in this class so now let's look at what kind of"
"10-03","2:50","services can be provided by DS so the first thing that comes into your"
"10-03","2:56","mind is probably the mapping between the hostname and IP address right host name"
"10-03","3:01","to IP address translation actually vs does much more than that"
"10-03","3:08","okay so there are three more other functions that are provided by the DNS"
"10-03","3:13","first one host Alice house editing for what does this mean this means uh for"
"10-03","3:20","each cost it may have a canonical name and also a A-list name for example the"
"10-03","3:26","canonical name is relay one or really or whatever that's West"
"10-03","3:32","Coast dot enterprise.com this is the canonical name but the Alias"
"10-03","3:39","name that is too long right nobody's going to remember that but the Alias name can be Enterprise outcome or www"
"10-03","3:46","dot enterprise.com which are much easier to remember"
"10-03","3:52","okay so that is actually the uh aliasing it provides a host a lesson okay and it"
"10-03","3:59","also provides the mail server Alice okay that means the mail server may have"
"10-03","4:05","a very long name but we can also give it a short Alias to remember it easily"
"10-03","4:11","if you still remember in the demo of email we actually use the"
"10-03","4:18","we actually used the alaci um"
"10-03","4:23","do you see this telnet"
"10-03","4:29","smtp.csus.edu this smtp.csus.edu is actually a ALS"
"10-03","4:37","the real name for this server is this one smtp.settling.csus.edu"
"10-03","4:47","okay that's the real name is longer okay it's longer than that"
"10-03","4:53","um that's the third type okay third additional type the last one"
"10-03","5:00","that can be done by the DNS is called the load distribution okay load"
"10-03","5:06","distribution um as you can imagine for those big companies okay the web server the web"
"10-03","5:13","server may be accessed um a lot you imagine about google.com"
"10-03","5:20","amazon.com right so it's usually it's not possible to"
"10-03","5:26","have just one web server serving for all the uh clients it's not possible right"
"10-03","5:34","so in this case what can we do what we can do is we give it to just the one"
"10-03","5:41","name okay one name like google.com but we actually assign multiple IP addresses to"
"10-03","5:49","this one name okay then in this case when people access google.com Okay then we can kind"
"10-03","5:58","of distribute the load to google.com to many different IP addresses okay that"
"10-03","6:04","means to many different machines okay so this is called load distribution"
"10-03","6:09","so that's another service that can be done by DNS okay"
"10-03","6:15","so then the next question we need to consider is oh how can we how can we deploy this DNS"
"10-03","6:23","system can we just use one centralized server"
"10-03","6:29","it's like for for example web application can we just use one"
"10-03","6:34","centralized DNS server so we cannot do that for a number of"
"10-03","6:40","reasons the first is single point of failure that means if this server is down okay"
"10-03","6:47","then we cannot provide DNS service for the entire world"
"10-03","6:52","okay then in this case the entire internet system this is very important because you can you can think about this"
"10-03","7:00","for all the clients around or whatever if they want to communicate usually they"
"10-03","7:07","need the answers the answer is essential okay nobody's going to type in IP"
"10-03","7:13","address they all type in the hostname okay if the DS service is not there"
"10-03","7:20","is uh the entire internet is going it's going it's going down okay this is even"
"10-03","7:26","worse than for example a web service a web server is down it can probably only"
"10-03","7:32","impact one specific company and the clients to that specific company but if"
"10-03","7:38","this uh the answer is done then it will impact this entire internet for the"
"10-03","7:45","entire world okay and another thing we need to consider is if we have one single server then the"
"10-03","7:52","traffic volume is is huge This Server can easily be overwhelmed okay"
"10-03","7:58","and then we also need to consider uh where we should put the centralized"
"10-03","8:05","database because everyone wants this to be close to them right but we we do not"
"10-03","8:10","have like a perfect location for the entire world right"
"10-03","8:16","um then the last thing is the maintenance okay if we have one single server this server has to be there"
"10-03","8:22","forever and it has to be up and running forever we cannot afford"
"10-03","8:30","shutting it down to do maintenance we cannot okay so those are all the things"
"10-03","8:35","we need to consider so the major reason to summarize one"
"10-03","8:41","word one sentence it means if we have a single server then it it doesn't scale"
"10-03","8:46","okay so in reality DNS is actually a distributed hierarchical database okay"
"10-03","8:55","um so that means we firstly have the root DN server okay and then the second layer uh"
"10-03","9:05","is called the top flower the mean name servers okay that means they are.com dot"
"10-03","9:12","org.edu okay so those are called top level the new email servers and finally"
"10-03","9:19","the last layer the lowest layer is called the authoritative name servers"
"10-03","9:25","okay authoritative name servers so generally if a clients wants IP address"
"10-03","9:30","for Amazon.com okay uh your relay or"
"10-03","9:36","theoretically the client will need to First Contact the root"
"10-03","9:42","to find the IP address for.com DN server"
"10-03","9:47","and then the client will query the.com DN server to get the"
"10-03","9:53","amazon.com's authoritative DN server okay that means"
"10-03","10:00","from this one we will get the contact of this one okay then finally we go to the"
"10-03","10:07","amazon.com the answer we're together IP address for Amazon.com"
"10-03","10:12","okay so this is like for example for our department"
"10-03","10:17","okay for our department if we have uh Veronica as the authoritative name"
"10-03","10:23","server then the college level we may have somebody there let's see it's our day our day is there as the authority so"
"10-03","10:31","let's see this is the president"
"10-03","10:37","and the women have the thing and we may have let's use the chair okay"
"10-03","10:44","instead of Veronica okay let's say if you want to find a contact"
"10-03","10:50","information for me okay I'm a regular faculty in the department of computer science then you have to contact the"
"10-03","10:57","president say hey do you know the contact information for Dean Daniel for ECS"
"10-03","11:03","quality is of VCS and then you'll find the content and then you get the"
"10-03","11:09","information for the thing and then you cut the thing and asking hey do you have the contact information for the chair"
"10-03","11:15","and the final encounter the chair to get the contact number for me so that is the entire process"
"10-03","11:21","okay so it's hierarchical um if we look at the name server the"
"10-03","11:27","root name servers we for the entire world okay for the entire world we have"
"10-03","11:33","13 logical root name servers worldwide okay"
"10-03","11:39","as a marketing this map um when we say logical servers that"
"10-03","11:45","means um while minority console does not really mean one physical server and one logical"
"10-03","11:52","server can have many many uh physical"
"10-03","11:57","servers okay it's just viewed as one server but as you can imagine"
"10-03","12:03","Apparently one physical server is not sufficient to serve the entire world right"
"10-03","12:10","um so basically the root name server context The Authority name server if"
"10-03","12:16","named mapping is not known okay to get the mapping and then the root names will"
"10-03","12:23","return the mapping to the local name server okay so um and we just mentioned the top level"
"10-03","12:29","domain server which is the second layer okay servers are responsible for.com org net"
"10-03","12:39","edu etc etc okay and it's also for all top level country domain names okay that"
"10-03","12:45","means like UK from CA um Japan okay"
"10-03","12:52","um so this organization this company Network"
"10-03","12:57","Solutions maintains the servers for.com TLD okay and for DOT edu is add your course"
"10-03","13:05","maintaining the top level domain servers okay for the authoritative uh DNS servers"
"10-03","13:13","which is the lowest layer okay each organization will maintain their own"
"10-03","13:19","authoritative DNS server okay the organization's own DNS servers"
"10-03","13:26","provide the authoritative hostname to IP mapping for the organization's name has"
"10-03","13:33","this means for example for sex States we have our own authoritative DN server the"
"10-03","13:39","reason we call it authoritative because only this DNS server knows the correct"
"10-03","13:46","mapping between IP address and house name for all the host e exact States"
"10-03","13:53","okay and authoritative the answer can be maintained by the organization or the"
"10-03","14:00","service provider okay those are the Third type of service"
"10-03","14:07","and there is one more time called the local DNS so low code DNS does not strictly belong"
"10-03","14:15","to hierarchy okay um so each ISP"
"10-03","14:22","has a one local DNS so for example for succeed we also have local DS so what is local dnf"
"10-03","14:30","what is the difference between look audience and and this one here so the local DNS is like the one"
"10-03","14:39","uh survey all the queries from this"
"10-03","14:44","organization for example safe State local DS will serve all the clients in within"
"10-03","14:53","succeed if you for example you want to know the uh IP address for google.com"
"10-03","14:58","you will ask a local DS and then local DNS will try to find out the answer for"
"10-03","15:05","you okay so that is the uh the local DS"
"10-03","15:11","my horse makes DNS query the query is sent to its local DS server so yeah some"
"10-03","15:17","of you may ask what is the difference between local DNS and authoritative DNS so authoritative DNS is is the one"
"10-03","15:25","maintaining the contact list okay but the local DNS is the one"
"10-03","15:33","answering your queries so it's like for our computer science"
"10-03","15:38","department probably the chair is the one maintaining the contact list for all the"
"10-03","15:44","faculty but if you want to ask the contact contact information for other faculty in"
"10-03","15:51","other universities you have to contact the let's say Veronica in this case"
"10-03","15:56","Veronica is the local DNA server okay she is helping you helping you to"
"10-03","16:03","find out the contact information for others does this make sense okay it's like the"
"10-03","16:10","chair is maintaining uh or the low the authority of DNS is"
"10-03","16:15","maintaining all the IP address and host name mapping for all the machines with"
"10-03","16:20","insect State okay but if you want to query about something like amazon.com"
"10-03","16:26","like ebay.com google.com Okay then you have to contact the local DS server okay"
"10-03","16:33","of course sometimes they are combined into one machine especially for small organization and sometimes they are"
"10-03","16:40","separate but they have different functions as you can see they are very different okay"
"10-03","16:46","and the local DS has a local cache of the recent name to address translation"
"10-03","16:51","pairs okay but this may be out of date um it's like"
"10-03","16:57","a proxy this will forward the query into the hierarchy that means uh"
"10-03","17:03","for example if you acquire about google.com and google.com is already cached in local DS then in this case"
"10-03","17:09","local DNS will directly provide you the answer but if google.com is not cached"
"10-03","17:15","in local DS then the local DNS will help you to make the query into the hierarchy"
"10-03","17:22","to basically local the answer will contact the root and ask hey do you know what is the IP address for google.com"
"10-03","17:28","Okay in reality when we do the DNS name resolution we have two ways one type is"
"10-03","17:35","called iterated comparis another type is called recursive query okay now let's"
"10-03","17:40","look at an example we have a requesting host here"
"10-03","17:46","okay cis.poly.edu this one is the requesting host which needs to find out the IP"
"10-03","17:53","address for some machine okay so then that Submachine is this gaia.cs.ums.edu"
"10-03","18:02","so basically the host at CIS of the poly.edu wants the IP address for"
"10-03","18:08","gaia.cs.ums.edu then for Italy the query"
"10-03","18:13","uh basically the contacted server replies with the name of the server to"
"10-03","18:20","contact okay so generally for for the very first step the requesting host will contact"
"10-03","18:27","the local DS okay contact the local DNS and say you"
"10-03","18:34","can see the local DNS is still belongs to poly.teu right so this local DNS"
"10-03","18:40","serves all the machines Within poly.edu"
"10-03","18:45","okay then this requesting host will ask the local DNC hey I want to find out the IP address"
"10-03","18:52","for gaia.cs.umass.edu could you please help me then the local DNS will say sure let me"
"10-03","18:59","help you okay and the local DNS will then contact the root design server"
"10-03","19:06","theoretically it's like this okay it will contact the root design server"
"10-03","19:14","oh I'm sorry I don't know this name okay but I know it belongs to dot edu so"
"10-03","19:24","please go ahead and contact This Server"
"10-03","19:29","okay so basically the root in step 3 the rooting s is returning the contact"
"10-03","19:35","information for DOT edu DN server okay then this local DS for poly.edu"
"10-03","19:44","will go ahead in step four go ahead to ask the dot edu DN server say hey could"
"10-03","19:50","you please help me find out the IP address for this machine and again the dot edu will say oh I'm"
"10-03","19:57","sorry I don't know I don't know the name but I know who you can contact it's like"
"10-03","20:03","the thing is saying hey I don't know but please go ahead to ask the Cs department chair here is the information for the"
"10-03","20:09","department chair okay then basically step five the edu DNS will return the IP"
"10-03","20:17","address for The Authority DNS for"
"10-03","20:22","umass.edu okay and say go ahead to contact that person"
"10-03","20:27","that machine then this in Step six look at the answer will again Ask the authoritative DNS server and say hey"
"10-03","20:34","could you please provide me the IP address for this machine and finally this authoritative DNS"
"10-03","20:42","will provide the IP address to the local audience and then now the local DS is"
"10-03","20:48","Happy local DNC hey I've I completed the work okay local DNS will return this IP"
"10-03","20:55","address to the requesting host okay now eventually that you requesting"
"10-03","21:01","house has the IP address for gaia.cs.umass.edu and then it will"
"10-03","21:07","contact the um it will contact this uh this machine"
"10-03","21:14","for further communication okay uh for example if this machine is a web server"
"10-03","21:19","we know they will continue to do the TCP connection and they will begin to start"
"10-03","21:25","with uh the HTTP request message and response message so this is a one time I uh and you can"
"10-03","21:34","see in this type every time when the server is contacted the server may not know the answer but the server will"
"10-03","21:40","redirect the local DNS to another server who may have the information right"
"10-03","21:48","um in recursive query is different okay in recursive query every server is very"
"10-03","21:55","responsible if the server do not know the information the server will say hey"
"10-03","22:01","please wait here okay hold on wait here and I'll go ahead to find the answer for"
"10-03","22:07","you okay so it's like that every server is very responsible so again you can see"
"10-03","22:14","this is the requesting host okay the requesting host will make a request to the local DNS"
"10-03","22:20","and then locally as well say okay let me find it out for you the local DS will"
"10-03","22:25","then contact the root DS L DNS will say hey I don't know the"
"10-03","22:32","answer but hold on let me find it out for you okay then root will go ahead in step 3"
"10-03","22:39","root will go ahead to contact the tlddsr and TLD will also say hey I don't know"
"10-03","22:46","but hold on wait here and I will find out for you so then in Step 4 TLD will"
"10-03","22:53","directly go ahead to contact the authoritative DNA server of cs.ms.edu"
"10-03","22:58","okay and finally find out the answer so in step five this authoritative DNS"
"10-03","23:06","server from UMass is providing answer to TLD and then TLD prior answer to the"
"10-03","23:12","roots and the final root provide the answer to the local DS okay"
"10-03","23:19","again with this answer local DNS will in Step 8 will provide this answer to the"
"10-03","23:26","requesting host with the cis.poly.edu okay"
"10-03","23:31","um the problem for this recursive query as you can see because every server is"
"10-03","23:38","very responsible so this actually puts the burden of name resolution on the"
"10-03","23:44","contact name server okay as you can imagine because there"
"10-03","23:49","are so many machines that that may contact the root yes then the root yes"
"10-03","23:56","will have very heavy workload because it has to be responsible for all the"
"10-03","24:02","quarries okay it needs to get the answer for all the queries so in this case the"
"10-03","24:09","root yes can be easily overwhelmed okay so that is the problem of the recursive"
"10-03","24:15","query um of course as in the future of course"
"10-03","24:21","now you can you can think about this um later maybe I I'll explain this again"
"10-03","24:26","actually um for the local DS"
"10-03","24:33","the local DNS May cache some answers directly"
"10-03","24:38","for example if you if everyone is visiting google.com"
"10-03","24:44","then the IP address for google.com may have already been cached on the local DS"
"10-03","24:52","okay in this case when a requesting host is requesting IP address for google.com"
"10-03","24:58","the local DNS does not need to do the step three two two to seven it doesn't"
"10-03","25:03","need to do two to seven okay it's it's the same thing here"
"10-03","25:09","same thing here no matter what kind it basically means the query is not needed"
"10-03","25:15","to the root to the TLD to the authoritative DNS server because local DS already knows the answer okay"
"10-03","25:22","um and also also the local DNS may also"
"10-03","25:28","cash the IP address for root and IP address for TLD"
"10-03","25:34","okay why because we do not have a lot of root ntlds"
"10-03","25:40","okay we do not have a lot um so it's very easy for the local DN"
"10-03","25:45","server to Cache those IP addresses it's like you if you already have the"
"10-03","25:51","president and the things contact information okay every time we need to"
"10-03","25:57","do a query you still need to go back to the present you don't need to right you"
"10-03","26:03","don't need to contact the project again to find out the contact information for the thing because the things information"
"10-03","26:09","is already cached at the local DNS okay it's the"
"10-03","26:15","same thing here if the local DS has already cached the root and the TLD"
"10-03","26:21","okay the IP the IP address for TLD then every time when the local DS needs to"
"10-03","26:28","contact a um a TLD server it can go good a good"
"10-03","26:35","content that directly without consulting the root DS okay"
"10-03","26:42","so that is something you need to pay attention um and for the cash okay the cash"
"10-03","26:50","entries time out after some time for this time we call it time to expire TTL"
"10-03","26:56","you probably um are very familiar with TTL right now right so time to leave"
"10-03","27:03","um so the cash has some time uh been there but it will finally"
"10-03","27:09","disappear okay uh and again as I mentioned the TLD server typically caches in the local audience name"
"10-03","27:16","servers okay and also need to pay attention the cash entries may be out of"
"10-03","27:22","date okay um then in this case if for example if"
"10-03","27:27","you imagine one name one host one host okay uh changes the IP address"
"10-03","27:35","then this may not be no internet Wild"
"10-03","27:41","internet wide until all the ttls expire"
"10-03","27:46","okay only after all the ttls higher than everyone knows everyone will everything"
"10-03","27:52","else will uh have the new IP we'll do a new query and"
"10-03","27:58","get the new IP address okay before that this may not be known internet-wide okay"
"10-03","28:04","so those are the information you need to know any questions"
"10-03","28:12","okay um so another thing is about the DNS"
"10-03","28:18","directors okay um so basically as we said the DNS means"
"10-03","28:24","a database then in the database okay in the database um they will store the records of the DS"
"10-03","28:32","okay so how how is the record store it's like this"
"10-03","28:37","foreign the type and the TTL so that is the"
"10-03","28:46","format okay um so basically for the type we have"
"10-03","28:51","four types okay type A which means it's a mapping"
"10-03","28:57","between the name and the hostname and IP address"
"10-03","29:03","okay which means for type A okay"
"10-03","29:09","uh let's see if we have pass.com"
"10-03","29:15","okay and if let's see the IP address is uh"
"10-03","29:22","this is the IP address for test.com then in this case we will have the name"
"10-03","29:29","as task.com this is the machine name okay the value will be the IP address"
"10-03","29:36","and the type is a the TDL can be for example 1000 seconds and this is the"
"10-03","29:43","type aim for type NS type NS in type NS patients the name"
"10-03","29:51","is the domain name and the value is the hostname of authoritative name"
"10-03","29:58","servers for this domain okay so basically we will use Type n s"
"10-03","30:04","to provide uh the the authoritative name"
"10-03","30:10","server for this domain so for it for example again if we have"
"10-03","30:17","foreign"
"10-03","30:26","if the authoritative name server for this dummy is"
"10-03","30:37","dns.test.com then this is type NS"
"10-03","30:44","and the aspiration the TTL can still be housing"
"10-03","30:50","okay this is the name server type the third type the third type is the same name type"
"10-03","30:58","so in this case for say name type the name is the A-list name for some canonical"
"10-03","31:05","name it's the Alias okay again this is a test.com and then the canonical name"
"10-03","31:12","can be"
"10-03","31:28","so this is Type C name"
"10-03","31:35","okay this third type and the fourth type is"
"10-03","31:40","the MX and MX is basically providing the male silver okay for example we can have"
"10-03","32:01","foreign"
"10-03","32:09","types the name and the values are different okay so the last one for test"
"10-03","32:16","outcome the names the mail server is called neo.test.com of course it can be"
"10-03","32:21","other names or other email servers it can be smtp.test.com"
"10-03","32:27","with whatever mail server you have you just put the name there and then this is MX type and the tkl is 1000 okay so this"
"10-03","32:36","will become a test problem in the exam in exam I may ask you to"
"10-03","32:45","write down some records okay for example I give you the domain"
"10-03","32:51","name the IP address the host name and I ask you to provide uh uh maybe NS type"
"10-03","32:58","or whatever type okay so then you need to know how to write this record correctly"
"10-03","33:04","okay questions"
"10-03","33:14","is asking what's the difference between hostname and domain name"
"10-03","33:19","um so hostname hostname is uh the name for"
"10-03","33:26","a machine okay and the mean name is usually um usually means um"
"10-03","33:33","the for example for uh this for this domains the how we reference them in for"
"10-03","33:40","example csus.edu can be a domain name but it can"
"10-03","33:45","also be the host name sometimes okay especially when we use for example we use a"
"10-03","33:52","um csusw to refer to the web server okay but the host name can also be something"
"10-03","33:57","else hostname can also be"
"10-03","34:03","smtp.test.edu.test.com okay then in this case the host name is the hostname for"
"10-03","34:08","this email server okay so um the domain name is like a family"
"10-03","34:14","name okay but sometimes the host name is is just the same as the domain name"
"10-03","34:21","especially for the web server because we usually refer to um for example google.com can be the"
"10-03","34:27","main name and google.com can also be in the host name for the web server Google okay but the mail server and DN server"
"10-03","34:35","database servers may have different names okay"
"10-03","34:41","all right so then let's look at the DNS protocol uh and also the message format"
"10-03","34:47","for DNS the query and reply message they both share the same message format it's"
"10-03","34:53","like that in the in the figure short here in the table short here okay as you can see for the message hacker for the"
"10-03","35:01","message header we have identification number which is a 16 bit number this is"
"10-03","35:07","uh used for query and reply okay so the query and reply message will share the"
"10-03","35:13","same identification number okay to indicate oh this is the reply for that"
"10-03","35:19","specific query okay and then um after that we have two guys of flex"
"10-03","35:26","okay uh another 16 bits is used for Flags in the flags it may indicate this"
"10-03","35:33","is a query or reply message okay and it may indicate uh if recursion is desired or"
"10-03","35:42","uh if your current is available okay and it may also indicate if the reply is"
"10-03","35:49","authoritative or not okay if the reply is authoritative that"
"10-03","35:55","means the reply comes from the authoritative name server directly"
"10-03","36:00","okay if the reply is not authoritative that means the reply is from the local"
"10-03","36:07","DS the cache is from the cache it's not from the original authoritative name"
"10-03","36:13","server okay so after that you may see uh the number"
"10-03","36:18","of questions uh number of RRS R Us means resource records okay and"
"10-03","36:26","the number of authority authority errors and number of additional hours okay so here uh these four are just the numbers"
"10-03","36:34","okay that's just the numbers and then after that we will see the questions"
"10-03","36:41","okay uh if this is a quarry then the questions will be shown here so the name"
"10-03","36:47","and type fields for query and if this is a response message then the answers will be say uh in the in"
"10-03","36:56","this field okay the response to the records in response to the card will be shown in"
"10-03","37:02","this field and um we also have the records for"
"10-03","37:09","authoritative name servers and there are also some additional information that"
"10-03","37:15","may be helpful for example um you may have the information for the"
"10-03","37:21","authoritative name servers um and other things okay"
"10-03","37:27","all right so let's look at some examples right these um experiments here just for"
"10-03","37:33","fun okay so a very commonly used tool"
"10-03","37:38","4ds query is the NS lookup okay you can try it on your own at home so for"
"10-03","37:45","example here I firstly did let's look up for google.com okay"
"10-03","37:51","and this is what I get this is the response okay and you can see the first part"
"10-03","38:02","This Server and address pay attention This Server and address is not the IP"
"10-03","38:08","address for google.com this is not the answer this just means"
"10-03","38:19","this just means is the local DNA server means which"
"10-03","38:25","local DNS server is providing you the answer okay and then if you look at the answer"
"10-03","38:32","here the non-authoritative answer"
"10-03","38:37","okay you can see the IP address for google.com is 200 this one I don't want to read it"
"10-03","38:44","okay but this is the IP address for google.com okay"
"10-03","38:59","and also you need to pay attention"
"10-03","39:05","this is a non-authoritative answer that means the answer comes from the"
"10-03","39:12","cache from the local DS the answer does not come from the authoritative name"
"10-03","39:19","server of Google okay pay attention to that and after that I did another query"
"10-03","39:24","our csus.edu as you can see it is showing the same"
"10-03","39:31","IP address 251-251 again that is the local DN server that means it's still"
"10-03","39:37","the same server replying to me okay and some of you may ask what is this"
"10-03","39:43","this is the Pearl number 53 is the post number for DDS service"
"10-03","39:50","okay it's like 84 HTTP 25 for email okay and then you can see the answer for"
"10-03","39:58","csus.edu is"
"10-03","40:04","130.86.9.189 this is the IP address for Sac State for for csus.edu okay"
"10-03","40:10","and then I did another query I'm very curious so I call it"
"10-03","40:17","dns.csus.edu I want to know the IP address for DNS of CN csus.edu"
"10-03","40:24","but unfortunately the server cannot find this dns.csus.edu"
"10-03","40:32","that means safety do not have this machine does not have this machine"
"10-03","40:38","then I'm curious if this is not the DNS server then who is the answer"
"10-03","40:46","so then I did a lookup again and this time I type in the type"
"10-03","40:53","equal to NS csus.edu [Music] okay this is two"
"10-03","41:03","get the name server for CSUS EDU so I get two answers"
"10-03","41:09","apparently the name for CSU for the CSUS CDU the answer is not"
"10-03","41:16","ds.csus.edu it's actually s4.csus.edu and as through.csus.edu"
"10-03","41:24","okay um and then I'm again very curious I want to know which one is this machine"
"10-03","41:33","okay is this S4 os3 so I did another NS lookup"
"10-03","41:41","as4.csus.edu and then you can see actually this is an S4"
"10-03","41:49","right it's ns4 and then I did another lookup of S3 and it returns me a"
"10-03","41:56","different IP address so this proves that is actually as for"
"10-03","42:02","providing the local DN service to me and it also shows you that on exact State we"
"10-03","42:09","actually have more than one DN servers okay"
"10-03","42:15","and then I did another lookup okay what I look up is I want last time to"
"10-03","42:23","remember we talked about the smtp.csuf.edu right so this is the mail"
"10-03","42:30","server do you remember mail server adjusted but we want to know"
"10-03","42:37","the canonical name for this one and after that you can see after the lookup you can see I get the canonical"
"10-03","42:45","name which is smtp.statlink.csus.edu okay"
"10-03","42:51","so you can do the same practice at home if you like um"
"10-03","42:56","this is a this is like exploring process very interesting okay so then now you understand how you can do the lookup"
"10-03","43:03","okay any questions"
"10-03","43:10","okay so another thing I want to emphasize is"
"10-03","43:16","about inserting records into DS so why we need to re research records into DS"
"10-03","43:24","you imagine in a scenario for example you are um you have a new company a new startup"
"10-03","43:30","which is called for example Network Utopia okay and you want everybody to"
"10-03","43:36","know about your network right to know about your company then you have to register your company at the DNS"
"10-03","43:44","register okay you basically need to register this name Network utopia.com"
"10-03","43:54","okay so then what you need to do is you need to"
"10-03","44:00","provide two things at least two records okay one thing is that you need to tell"
"10-03","44:08","others what is your DNS server that is very important because DS server the D"
"10-03","44:17","answer reveal provides all the mappings between the host between all host and"
"10-03","44:22","the IP addresses so the answer is like the contact person you need to let"
"10-03","44:28","others know who your contact person is otherwise nobody can contact you right"
"10-03","44:33","nobody can reach reach out to you that's why the very first directory need"
"10-03","44:38","to insert is the network utopia.com and provide the DNS"
"10-03","44:46","the DNS server name and this is type NS Type n s because that is used to provide"
"10-03","44:53","the DNS server's name okay but pay attention this is just providing"
"10-03","45:00","the name but the question is how can others contact him you also need to"
"10-03","45:05","insert another record into the um"
"10-03","45:11","uh TLD server you also need to tell others IP address for the CNN's name server"
"10-03","45:21","okay and then others will know how to contact it so for this record it's type"
"10-03","45:27","A because this is a the name"
"10-03","45:32","the IP this is type A record okay you are providing a mapping between IP and a"
"10-03","45:38","name okay so this will become a test problem"
"10-03","45:44","so in the test I may ask to you if you have a new startup"
"10-03","45:51","okay if you want to let others know your company your your"
"10-03","45:58","um the IP address for all your domain name what would you do what are the two"
"10-03","46:04","records that you will insert into TLD for sure okay at least two records so"
"10-03","46:11","again keep that in your mind first thing is tell others who is your DN server use"
"10-03","46:17","the using the NS type and then tell others the IP address for this DNS"
"10-03","46:23","server using the type a record okay those are the two records you need to"
"10-03","46:29","add of course you you need to also include another type a record for your"
"10-03","46:36","web server right and then you need to also insert"
"10-03","46:41","um MX record for this dummy that means you need to provide a mail server okay"
"10-03","46:48","and with all those four then you are complete Okay so"
"10-03","46:55","but at least you need to insert the DNS and then the IP address for the S okay"
"10-03","47:01","all right so the last thing we want to talk about very quickly today is uh"
"10-03","47:06","about attacking 2DS okay uh so a very"
"10-03","47:12","common type of the attacking is the DDOS attack he does attack basically means"
"10-03","47:17","bombard the root servers with traffic so we if we send you as you can imagine if we send a lot of queries okay and if all"
"10-03","47:25","those colors go to the root server prove DNS that will cause Radiance will be all"
"10-03","47:32","around so this is the DDOS attack okay but in reality in reality is very"
"10-03","47:39","challenging or very hard to attack the rootiness"
"10-03","47:44","can we imagine why because the root yes"
"10-03","47:51","okay in reality is not contacted a lot because the TLD servers as we mentioned"
"10-03","47:58","are already uh already cached in the local DS okay it's like with everyone"
"10-03","48:07","all the local audience already has the content information for the thing they"
"10-03","48:12","don't want to bother the president again because they already know how to contact the thing so what what is the rationale"
"10-03","48:18","to contact the president again so that's why in most cases"
"10-03","48:24","attacking the routine server is actually very difficult but uh doing the details"
"10-03","48:31","to the TLD servers is possible okay it's possible because the TRD server may"
"10-03","48:37","be contacted a lot um so that is uh that is the uh the details"
"10-03","48:43","attack okay and another type of attack is called the redirect attacks okay and uh"
"10-03","48:51","also DNS poisoning so this is a very common type so what is happening is"
"10-03","48:57","actually for example if this is the local DS"
"10-03","49:04","okay and then it will contact"
"10-03","49:09","the original routines or whatever or TLD"
"10-03","49:15","okay for example TLD name servers okay and then some people some money in the"
"10-03","49:23","middle okay will intercept the query so for example the TLD will return some"
"10-03","49:30","IP address right a real IP address but this bad person this bad guy will"
"10-03","49:35","actually intercept the query and provide a fake IP address"
"10-03","49:42","Pride provide a fake IP address to this local DS does this make sense okay give a fake"
"10-03","49:51","IP and this click it will be stored here at the local DS"
"10-03","49:57","okay it's cached there in the local DS then in this case we call this as DNS"
"10-03","50:04","poisoning the reason is because if there's somebody else the client is requesting for local DS contacting local"
"10-03","50:11","dance again uh for uh the IP address for some"
"10-03","50:16","machine okay let's see if this is uh again test.com"
"10-03","50:22","and now test.com has a fake IP and then this fake IP will be returned to client"
"10-03","50:28","if there are some other clients contacting the game for test.com the local DS will say oh I already have"
"10-03","50:35","the IP for test.com so the fake IP is returned again to the to another client"
"10-03","50:41","so that's why it's called pointing because um they are all cached here at the local"
"10-03","50:46","DS okay and yes poisoning can also happen"
"10-03","50:52","um between the other DN servers like between the root and TLD between the TLD"
"10-03","50:58","and the authoritative name so it doesn't need she doesn't necessarily happen between the local and others okay"
"10-03","51:06","so as long as a fake IP address is stored or cached in their server then"
"10-03","51:15","this is called against poisoning okay because then this cancer reveal"
"10-03","51:21","they are pro always provide the wrong IP address or the fake IP address okay"
"10-03","51:28","this is called the redirect attack another type of attack is called employed DNS for DDOS attack so this is"
"10-03","51:35","this one is also very interesting this one means when the client send out a"
"10-03","51:42","query it will use a spoof IP address"
"10-03","51:47","okay and it will send out a lot of queries using a spoof IP address and then as you"
"10-03","51:56","can imagine all those queries will have a response right and then all those"
"10-03","52:02","queries will will come back two"
"10-03","52:08","this IP address to this moved IP address then this both IP address is the target"
"10-03","52:14","IP actually it's the victim because it is receiving so many responses then this"
"10-03","52:20","is like DDOS attack uh in this attack you are pretending to be someone else to make a lot of queries"
"10-03","52:27","to the DNA servers and machine with that IP address will receive a lot of responses and that is the DDOS attack"
"10-03","52:34","Okay so"
"10-05","0:03","so we have learned uh two models before client server model and P2P model we"
"10-05","0:09","talked about the web the email the DNS these applications are mainly using the"
"10-05","0:15","client server model okay for example for web we know we have a web service we"
"10-05","0:21","have the web clients the clients programs are usually the Firefox the web browser right so Safari Firefox Chrome"
"10-05","0:29","Etc then for email application we also know it is uh using email server and also email client"
"10-05","0:37","the email client may be outlook for example then for DS for DS"
"10-05","0:43","it also uses a cleanser model because we have the answer we're serving all the"
"10-05","0:49","clients okay so then those clients who want to know the IP address for certain"
"10-05","0:58","host name then they can just acquire it via server okay so those are all the"
"10-05","1:03","client server applications and the in 2.5 we are going to talk about the P2P"
"10-05","1:10","applications which is peer-to-peer applications okay it is using a P2P"
"10-05","1:16","architecture which means it has all the features we have discussed before"
"10-05","1:22","regarding the P2P for example there is no server no always one server okay and"
"10-05","1:29","those up those end systems can directly communicate with each other they don't"
"10-05","1:34","need to communicate with the server we know in client server model these applications must this clients must"
"10-05","1:42","communicate with the server right they cannot communicate with the clients okay"
"10-05","1:47","but if P2P is different and also those peers are intermittently"
"10-05","1:55","connected and they can change their IP addresses as many times as they want okay so the architecture is changing the"
"10-05","2:04","the structure of this network may change a lot so um this this is the phase this is the"
"10-05","2:12","one of the features of P2P okay it makes the management of P2P actually uh very"
"10-05","2:18","difficult okay so there are some examples of P2P application like"
"10-05","2:24","for example B torrent BitTorrent is used for file distribution some of you may"
"10-05","2:29","have used this before um and it's uh it's actually it's a very"
"10-05","2:35","sometimes it's very fast okay it's very fast food for downloading but later I'm"
"10-05","2:40","gonna talk more about this okay how would the speed current work uh one of the feature you probably noticed is"
"10-05","2:47","sometimes you may use this kind of P2P application you feel like your machine"
"10-05","2:52","slows down a lot okay so we will talk about why and a second application is"
"10-05","3:01","actually one application that is used to worry um often in China for video streaming"
"10-05","3:09","okay and also Skype is another application so those are the some of the examples we will mention"
"10-05","3:16","um some of them later okay before we start to talk about the P2"
"10-05","3:21","application one thing we want to discuss is what is the performance of the P2P okay"
"10-05","3:30","so when compared with the client server model um what is the difference okay what is the"
"10-05","3:37","difference between client server model and P2P model basically means for example for for this file distribution"
"10-05","3:43","okay the question is how much time should be used to"
"10-05","3:52","distribute the files okay from one server to amperes okay we want to"
"10-05","3:59","compare the performance of cleanser model and the P2P model and see which"
"10-05","4:05","one is uh um it has better performance okay it is more efficient okay"
"10-05","4:12","so now let's look at this example in this example we assume we assume the file size is f okay and"
"10-05","4:22","you can see this is one server it has multiple"
"10-05","4:27","clients okay a lot of clients and we have a file F okay file size f"
"10-05","4:35","which we want to distribute to every client okay distribute to every client"
"10-05","4:41","and if we are using client server model okay uh let's say firstly let's look at"
"10-05","4:47","some of the parameters so firstly this server has a upload capacity"
"10-05","4:53","upload capacity means upload speed okay and for each client"
"10-05","5:01","it has one upload capacity and one download capacity which means uploading"
"10-05","5:07","speed and downloading speed okay for each client it has a different uploading speed and downloading speed"
"10-05","5:14","okay so for example for the peer eye we can see the uploading speed is UI"
"10-05","5:21","downloading speed is Di okay this is these are all the parameters you need to know before we do"
"10-05","5:27","any calculation now let's look at the client server model"
"10-05","5:34","you think about this for client server model if we want to distribute this file to every client"
"10-05","5:42","that means every time one client make a"
"10-05","5:47","request the server needed to upload this file to the network once"
"10-05","5:54","okay that means if we have on clients if these alkalines make n requests"
"10-05","6:01","then this server needs to upload this file and times okay that means it needs"
"10-05","6:09","to upload and copies of this file okay so then let's see"
"10-05","6:15","we if we want to understand the time used for distribution then we first need"
"10-05","6:22","to think okay how much time do we need for uploading right because we need to upload this and copies"
"10-05","6:29","so if the file size is f okay then the time to upload one copy"
"10-05","6:37","for the server okay is F over u s"
"10-05","6:43","okay this is the time to upload one copy if we want to upload any copies"
"10-05","6:49","of course the time is just earn time n times F over us okay that is"
"10-05","6:57","the uploading time okay pay attention uploading time and then we need to think"
"10-05","7:02","about the downloading time so from downloading we know the downloading speed for each"
"10-05","7:10","peer SDI right so for d for for number one for P1 is D1 for peer two is D2 okay"
"10-05","7:19","so that means that means the downloading speed is different"
"10-05","7:25","for every machine okay for every client if we consider"
"10-05","7:30","the downloading time then download time for the first computer will be"
"10-05","7:36","foreign the second computer will be"
"10-05","7:42","F over D2"
"10-05","7:48","okay so for the PRI then the downloading time the time used for downloading is f"
"10-05","7:53","over d i to continue okay and now we understand"
"10-05","8:00","for uploading the servers uploading time in total is"
"10-05","8:07","uh F over us and the downloading time is f f over D1"
"10-05","8:13","for one F or d242 Etc okay so these things can happen this this"
"10-05","8:19","downloading and uploading can happen in parallel then that means if we consider the time"
"10-05","8:27","we use the for file distribution then we only need to consider the"
"10-05","8:33","maximum time among all of these times right so among all of these numbers we"
"10-05","8:41","choose the maximum one then that is the time we use it for"
"10-05","8:46","file distribution for distribute this file to an uh clients right so that"
"10-05","8:53","means okay the distribution time should be the"
"10-05","9:01","maximum of"
"10-05","9:10","NF over us foreign"
"10-05","9:24","so should it be that maximum of all these numbers okay"
"10-05","9:29","then for this for f over D1 F over D2 F over D3 Etc"
"10-05","9:37","okay if we want to choose the maximum Y is very easy we only need to choose"
"10-05","9:44","F over dmin right the m means the minimum client downloading rate"
"10-05","9:52","okay the minimum client downloading speed okay So eventually this formula"
"10-05","9:58","becomes this okay becomes okay I only need to choose"
"10-05","10:04","the maximum of LF over us and F over dmin okay F over D minimum so among"
"10-05","10:12","these two numbers I choose the bigger one then that's fine okay this is a client server model I hope you"
"10-05","10:18","understand uh the rationale behind okay foreign"
"10-05","10:29","for P2P model we also need to upload and download okay the difference is this"
"10-05","10:36","time at the server side do we need to upload"
"10-05","10:41","and copies we do not we only need to upload one copy why because those peers"
"10-05","10:51","can serve each other okay so for example this one copy is uploaded and maybe P1"
"10-05","10:57","maybe the um Pier One downloaded this copy okay all"
"10-05","11:03","downloaded part of this copy then Pier One can begin sharing this with other"
"10-05","11:09","peers okay it so the the server do not need to be responsible to upload and"
"10-05","11:16","copies okay then in this case we can say oh okay the server the uploading speed"
"10-05","11:21","is us so the time for uploading for the server is only"
"10-05","11:27","F or us okay and then after that those are uploading"
"10-05","11:33","the uploading of the peers and the downloading okay among the peers can"
"10-05","11:39","happen simultaneously so in this case we should consider the uploading speed of all the peers okay so for example"
"10-05","11:46","this is U1 this is YouTube"
"10-05","11:53","okay the uploading speed of all the peers okay for one piece U1 for second place"
"10-05","12:01","YouTube so then you think about uploading speed if we want to uh finally"
"10-05","12:08","download and copies then the server together with all the peers they need to"
"10-05","12:13","upload and copied okay so that means in total the"
"10-05","12:19","uploading time should be"
"10-05","12:24","we need to upload Pages we need to upload NF okay and copied but the uploading speed"
"10-05","12:33","uploading speed this time is not the US okay it's actually the U.S"
"10-05","12:51","okay the uploading speed is all of the uploading speed including the server and the client"
"10-05","12:57","because those peers will also upload so that means it's equal to"
"10-05","13:04","foreign"
"10-05","13:10","so this is the time we used for uploading okay so here you can see we need two uh"
"10-05","13:18","two numbers for time for uploading time one is the one copy from the"
"10-05","13:25","server okay that means the time used IS F or us"
"10-05","13:30","the second number is this one is the total uploading time for earned copies"
"10-05","13:36","okay and for downloading downloading no surprise it's very easy I've already won"
"10-05","13:43","and forward d2f already through okay we continue right and then if you"
"10-05","13:49","want to find the maximum downloading time then we just do F over D minimum"
"10-05","13:55","okay so now among these three numbers among these three numbers"
"10-05","14:01","F over us NF over us plus all the uploading speeds"
"10-05","14:08","of the clients or of the peers and then F over dmin among these three numbers we"
"10-05","14:17","need to choose the maximum okay we need to choose the maximum then I know"
"10-05","14:23","probably by now you still don't know what is the which one is better which one has a better efficiency okay which"
"10-05","14:31","one can be distributed file quickly and let's now compare the DP to p"
"10-05","14:40","the distribution distribution time using P2P method and the DCS distribution time"
"10-05","14:47","using com cleanser method okay let's compare these two how can we can"
"10-05","14:53","we compare let's look at this assumption in this assumption we have uploading"
"10-05","15:00","route U okay we're assuming all the clients do remember for the clients we have uis"
"10-05","15:07","right so all the clients will assume they have the same uploading speed which is you and we assume F over U is one"
"10-05","15:15","hour we are assuming the server's uploading speed is 10 times faster case 10 U and we also assume the"
"10-05","15:23","download this video is the minimum downwind speed is uh equal to or bigger"
"10-05","15:29","than the or greater than the uploading speed of the server so D Min is"
"10-05","15:35","equal to or greater than us okay then in this case in this case"
"10-05","15:42","how can we compare these two okay let me just write down"
"10-05","15:48","here"
"10-05","16:10","foreign"
"10-05","16:33","so those are the two numbers those are the two formulas we want to compare and"
"10-05","16:38","then we want to say okay the assumption"
"10-05","16:45","is that all your eyes equal to you"
"10-05","17:08","okay so those are all the assumptions okay now let's look at these two"
"10-05","17:13","formulas one and two okay foreign"
"10-05","17:20","one for one we know d m i n is greater than uh us right"
"10-05","17:29","so then"
"10-05","17:38","it is correct because DMI n is bigger D minimum is"
"10-05","17:44","bigger than us so we know F over d m and n is of course smaller or equal to f o u"
"10-05","17:51","s right so then of course this will be smaller or equal to"
"10-05","18:00","NF or us right so then you can see okay comparing"
"10-05","18:05","these two okay then F over DMI is smaller that"
"10-05","18:14","will cause for one"
"10-05","18:29","right for one DCS then we do not need to look at F over DM anymore we only need"
"10-05","18:36","to look at NF over us okay AC equals to"
"10-05","18:45","maximum of over 10 U because U is equal to 10U okay and currently you probably"
"10-05","18:52","do not understand why I change it to you later you will see okay"
"10-05","18:57","then for two what will we know if we compare these"
"10-05","19:04","two F or U S and F over dmin we already know the answer"
"10-05","19:11","right so for two then"
"10-05","19:16","we don't need to look at F over DMI anymore because"
"10-05","19:21","we know it is smaller than F or us"
"10-05","19:28","so we only need to compare this one and"
"10-05","19:34","thank you and this one"
"10-05","19:40","okay and if we change this into U"
"10-05","19:49","h"
"10-05","19:56","us Plus let's change us into 10 U"
"10-05","20:03","okay foreign"
"10-05","20:14","and then let's we know the sum of all the uis if all the uis are the same we"
"10-05","20:21","have n clients so that means we have earn you right so we're only to compare these two"
"10-05","20:29","okay and now how how can we compare okay let's see"
"10-05","20:35","for these two how can we compare if"
"10-05","20:42","okay"
"10-05","20:48","if n goes to Infinity"
"10-05","20:54","okay then in this case we can change"
"10-05","21:01","we can still keep F over 10 U but for the second formula this becomes"
"10-05","21:09","if n goes to Infinity pay attention if n Go to Infinity then we can ignore this"
"10-05","21:15","10 U right because n will become like a huge number right then tangyu doesn't"
"10-05","21:21","matter anymore so then this becomes foreign"
"10-05","21:28","this becomes F and F over n u okay then this equals to"
"10-05","21:41","okay then we'll only need to compare F or rectangle and F over U of course F"
"10-05","21:47","over U is bigger right so this then equals two F over U"
"10-05","21:54","okay and then if you compare this one"
"10-05","21:59","and this one and I have over 10U and an F over U so what are their difference"
"10-05","22:05","the difference is if n goes to Infinity"
"10-05","22:18","DCF DCS will go to Infinity"
"10-05","22:24","right because you can see and is going to infinity and F over 10 U"
"10-05","22:30","of cos is equal to Infinity but if n goes to Infinity"
"10-05","22:36","okay then the t d p to P actually equals to F over UF overview window is one hour"
"10-05","22:45","it's a constant number right it doesn't change anymore do you see the difference"
"10-05","22:51","okay so the five if we plot this okay into a"
"10-05","22:56","figure then you can say when n goes to Infinity"
"10-05","23:02","okay for client server model it is ink the"
"10-05","23:07","distribution time is increasing linearly okay that means the distribution time"
"10-05","23:13","we all goes to Infinity also but if angle to Infinity for P2P model"
"10-05","23:21","eventually eventually this will"
"10-05","23:26","be approximate to one hour it will be closer and closer to one hour okay but"
"10-05","23:33","it will never increase Beyond one hour do you see the difference okay the difference is the difference is"
"10-05","23:41","for client server model again client server model if the number of clients is"
"10-05","23:47","going bigger and bigger then the time distribution time is increasing linearly"
"10-05","23:53","then the distribution time will go to Infinity but if we have more and more"
"10-05","24:00","peers in P2P model okay then this doesn't affect the"
"10-05","24:08","distribution time too much because the decision time will finally be"
"10-05","24:13","approximate to one hour be approximate to a constant number okay so that is the"
"10-05","24:21","difference between client server model and P2P model so this is actually very intuitive if you if you think this if"
"10-05","24:27","you're using analogy for example if I'm a server and the students in our class are the"
"10-05","24:34","clients if what I I'm the only one serving the entire class then I of"
"10-05","24:39","course I cannot handle a class that is very big if we have a thousand students"
"10-05","24:45","how can I handle that right because all the requests are coming to me but if we are using P2P model which"
"10-05","24:52","means everybody is teaching each other so all the students can teach each other okay then when you are requesting for"
"10-05","24:59","service you are also providing service in this case it doesn't increase my"
"10-05","25:04","workload right so then the distribution time or the serving time okay the"
"10-05","25:10","service time is much much shorter compared to client server model okay"
"10-05","25:16","so for this part do not worry okay I know you you are probably overwhelmed"
"10-05","25:22","about this slide okay no test"
"10-05","25:28","on this slide okay but"
"10-05","25:33","I will have tests regarding this slide that means you don't need to know how we"
"10-05","25:40","finally do the calculation but you need to understand what is the rationale"
"10-05","25:45","behind and what is the takeaway message okay the takeaway message is for P2P"
"10-05","25:52","model the distribution time we'll become will be close close to a"
"10-05","25:59","constant number as the number of clients increasing or the number of peers increasing but for client server model"
"10-05","26:05","the distribution time will increase linearly as the number of clients increase okay so those are the uh"
"10-05","26:14","current conclusions you need to know okay so B current is one of the P2P file"
"10-05","26:20","distribution application probably you have used this before but you may not understand the mechanism"
"10-05","26:27","behind uTorrent it is a very smart design I would say so generally the file"
"10-05","26:33","is divided into the 256 KB chunks the peers in this torrent will send and"
"10-05","26:41","receive the file chunks they are exchanging the file chunks they basically serve each other when they are"
"10-05","26:48","also got service from each other so basically in BitTorrent we have one"
"10-05","26:53","server or we call it tracker this server is not the real server in the client"
"10-05","27:00","server model and not in that sense but it's just a one tracker this track"
"10-05","27:06","reveal tracks the peers participating in the torrent and then torrent is basically a group of"
"10-05","27:12","peers exchanging the file chunks so let's say if a new user arrives Alice"
"10-05","27:19","arrives then Alice will firstly obtain the list of peers from the tracker"
"10-05","27:26","and then starts exchanging the file chunks with appears in this torrent so"
"10-05","27:32","that is the general idea but when up here joining a torrent for"
"10-05","27:38","example when Alice firstly joined this torrent it has no chance but"
"10-05","27:44","it will accumulate them over time from other peers so Alice will gradually"
"10-05","27:49","collect more and more final chance of course this peer will also need to register with the tracker to get list"
"10-05","27:56","their own peers and connect to the subnetal appearance basically for those we call them as Neighbors"
"10-05","28:03","and they also need to pay attention when downloading the peer will upload the"
"10-05","28:08","chunks to other peers okay so it is getting service and is also providing"
"10-05","28:13","service to others so the pr makes change peers with whom it exchange chunks that means"
"10-05","28:22","Alice may decide to exchange chunks with ABC right now but later it may decide to"
"10-05","28:28","exchange chunks with the EFG so the peers the peer may decide to"
"10-05","28:34","change the peers with whom it is changed the chunks and also the peers may come"
"10-05","28:40","and go once up here gets the entire file it may have two options one option is"
"10-05","28:48","is it May be selfish and decide to live so I'm down I'm done with my file okay I"
"10-05","28:55","don't want to stay here to provide more service it's a selfish behavior but it's a it's one option that the speaker can"
"10-05","29:03","can do another option is it can stay in the storage and provide the service to"
"10-05","29:11","other peers those are the two options and one request importance"
"10-05","29:18","okay one requesting for chunks at any given time different periods have"
"10-05","29:24","different subsets of file chunks so that means that means for example at"
"10-05","29:31","this time the Alice will ask the peer and say hey I'm interested in this file"
"10-05","29:37","what kind of file chunks do you have at you at your site at least we'll ask this"
"10-05","29:43","question to each peer and then those cures will say for example let's see"
"10-05","29:51","here a pra may say oh I have one two three four"
"10-05","29:58","five let's see let's see if this file has a one two three four"
"10-05","30:13","let's say this one has a one two three four five chunks and a said I have uh"
"10-05","30:19","one two three four five and B said"
"10-05","30:27","he said I have two three and four she said"
"10-05","30:35","I have three four and five"
"10-05","30:42","D said I have two three and five so you can see at any given time different"
"10-05","30:47","peers may have different subsets oh this file chunks then uh purely Alice"
"10-05","30:55","will check with each pure what kind of uh what what uh file"
"10-05","31:00","chances they have then at least need to request for the chunks"
"10-05","31:08","and it's need to make requests to ABCD so pay attention there is one very"
"10-05","31:14","important principle here this may be a test problem Alice will"
"10-05","31:21","ask your question missing chunks from the peers it will follow a principle called rarest first what does this mean"
"10-05","31:29","for example if you look at a b c d okay A has one two three four"
"10-05","31:34","five B has two three four C has three four five D has two through five and in this case in this case you can"
"10-05","31:41","say two has multiple copies two is available on"
"10-05","31:47","a b and also d third is available on a b c and d four"
"10-05","31:55","is available on a b c and five is available on ACD but one is available"
"10-05","32:03","only on a so then one is the rarest piece then in"
"10-05","32:11","this case Alice will request the the rarest piece first that means Alice will"
"10-05","32:17","firstly contact a to get the chunk one"
"10-05","32:24","why because remember this is a P2P Network P2P means every peer can come"
"10-05","32:31","and go especially when a for example a already has one two three four five it gets all"
"10-05","32:37","the file right all the file chunks so Amy decide to leave if a leave then"
"10-05","32:42","nobody has the chunk of one then nobody can get the complete file"
"10-05","32:49","so that is the issue that's why Alice will need to request the rarest chunks"
"10-05","32:54","first okay pay attention to that this will appear on the test and then"
"10-05","33:00","when sending a chance let's send you the chunks B torrent has a very interesting"
"10-05","33:06","mechanism called tit for attack so what does this mean this means Alice sends"
"10-05","33:11","chunks to those four peers currently sending her chunks at the highest rate"
"10-05","33:18","so there are so many cheers right so many peers so Alice among these appears"
"10-05","33:23","Alice will say oh okay so these four these four peers are sending me the file"
"10-05","33:30","jumps at the higher street so they are the factors so I like this four so that"
"10-05","33:35","IO will also send them I'll be also sent them the"
"10-05","33:42","bottoms at my highest at the High Street so then it will choose the top four"
"10-05","33:48","peers then the other peers will be talked talked means the other peers"
"10-05","33:54","cannot receive file chunks from Alice Alice will just choose the best of work"
"10-05","33:59","and ignore the remaining say hey I don't want to become friends with you because you are not good enough so as we are not"
"10-05","34:08","sent the chunks to Alice to those peers so it will only choose the basketball of"
"10-05","34:16","course L is the best four may change so Alice will do re-evaluation of the top"
"10-05","34:23","four every 10 seconds and always choose the top four"
"10-05","34:28","then you may say um if so so you may say what if there are another Noob here coming out who is"
"10-05","34:36","really really fast right so you have to give opportunity to other peers also that's why every 30 seconds at least"
"10-05","34:44","randomly select another appear randomly select another appear from the group and"
"10-05","34:50","then start sending tabs if this peer is really good and Alice is not"
"10-05","34:57","disappointed then of course L is real optimistically and choke disappear and"
"10-05","35:03","say oh okay you are new but you're good enough you can join my top four then I we become friends I can send the"
"10-05","35:10","um the file trans to you but if of course if this appear is not good enough"
"10-05","35:16","then Alice will also talk this here and and refuse to communicate with this peer"
"10-05","35:23","so this is like the principle then following this principle you can see Alice can always"
"10-05","35:30","can always communicate with the best four um our cause and it may also become the"
"10-05","35:37","one of the best four for the for the other peers so let's see an example here we have Alice and we have Bob so Alice"
"10-05","35:46","optimistically and talksport Bob is new then Alice may become one of Bob's top"
"10-05","35:55","four providers so Bob is very happy Bob recipe and say okay I want to send you"
"10-05","36:03","at the highest rate also so number becomes one of Alice's"
"10-05","36:08","top four providers then at least of course will do the same right so that in this way you can see"
"10-05","36:17","teeth voltage ensures that each peer can find the better trading"
"10-05","36:26","partners and get the file faster okay so this is a I would say this is a why"
"10-05","36:33","I see a t-test t410 is a very smart mechanism okay so it ensures the peers"
"10-05","36:40","can always find their best Partners to to uh exchange file terms okay all right"
"10-05","36:48","okay pay attention this may appear on the test so in the test I made ask you"
"10-05","36:54","what is uh for example I may ask you what is the best basic mechanism for T4"
"10-05","37:00","touch or what is the effect of what you did for that okay so this is something"
"10-05","37:05","you need to pay attention foreign"
"10-05","37:11","so then the next product we are going to discuss is the video streaming and"
"10-07","0:02","so then the next product we are going to discuss is the video streaming and the content distribution Network"
"10-07","0:09","video is a very important part in application layer okay among all of"
"10-07","0:15","these applications because we almost use video every day right uh the video"
"10-07","0:20","traffic is actually one of the major consumer of the internet bandwidth"
"10-07","0:26","um for example the Netflix YouTube they took about 37 percent at 16 percent of"
"10-07","0:31","the downstream residential ISP traffic respectively this was your old data okay"
"10-07","0:37","this is not updated you can say maybe it is even bigger percentage right and also"
"10-07","0:42","the YouTube users was 1 billion and Netflix users was 75 million but now I"
"10-07","0:49","as I again this number make become bigger anyway we we faced several"
"10-07","0:54","challenges we said with at least two challenges in the video streaming so one"
"10-07","0:59","challenge is about the skill how can we reach so many users"
"10-07","1:07","can we use just one single Mega video server will this work"
"10-07","1:14","apparently this will not work right we have discussed this question in web"
"10-07","1:20","service in DNS for those even for those applications the single server may not work okay"
"10-07","1:28","because of like single point of failure the scalability issue the uh the"
"10-07","1:34","location where should we put this server right because of a number of problems the Second Challenge is the"
"10-07","1:40","heterogeneity problem what does this mean this means different users actually"
"10-07","1:45","have different capabilities if you think about this so for example some users are using a"
"10-07","1:53","mobile phone some users are using wireless network right some some users"
"10-07","1:58","may have a bigger benefit but some may have a very"
"10-07","2:03","poor benefit but in this case how can we accommodate all these different users with different"
"10-07","2:10","capabilities how can we provide very smooth experience to them this is"
"10-07","2:16","actually another I would say huge challenge in the video application"
"10-07","2:21","so the solution to the about problem is that we need to have some kind of"
"10-07","2:26","distributed infrastructure at application Level to ensure smooth experience of the users"
"10-07","2:34","in video streaming before we talk about the the video application let's first look at the"
"10-07","2:41","video itself so we do is basically a sequence of images you think something"
"10-07","2:47","is moving the video but actually it's not it's actually just a number of static images a sequence of static"
"10-07","2:55","images displayed at a consonance rate that makes you feel like oh the things"
"10-07","3:01","are moving for each image for each image it's just an area of pixels each pixel"
"10-07","3:09","is usually represented by the Beats for example it may be represented by the red green blue color"
"10-07","3:16","for red we know it's it can be one byte for blue it can be one by Green it can"
"10-07","3:22","be one byte we can use for example 24 bits to represent one pixel of course"
"10-07","3:28","that's just one method there are many different methods to represent a digital"
"10-07","3:34","image but anime for image and for video we have"
"10-07","3:42","different encoding methods so for example one method is called spatial"
"10-07","3:47","encoding so coding means we use redundancy within and between the images"
"10-07","3:53","to decrease the number of bits used to encode the image so that means for"
"10-07","3:59","example here for spatial coding we can say we have a bunch of pixels in the same"
"10-07","4:06","color and it's in purple if we can use for example if we can use nine to"
"10-07","4:12","represent purple color because in reality we do not use 9 to"
"10-07","4:19","represent the purple color right but this is just for for demonstration for example so if we use 9 to wrap it in a"
"10-07","4:26","purple color if we have 1000 pixels in this one row then that"
"10-07","4:36","this is one row we have one thousand pixels then when we have if we want to"
"10-07","4:41","include this then we have to do"
"10-07","4:51","so we have say nine nine nine nine so we continue in total we have one thousand"
"10-07","4:58","nines to wraps in this one thousand purple color pixels but if we are doing"
"10-07","5:04","Special encoding we don't need to we don't need to do this we can just say"
"10-07","5:09","okay let's do this using"
"10-07","5:14","nine and one thousand what does this mean this means the color value is nine"
"10-07","5:20","and the number of repeated values is one thousand so this 9 is repeated for one"
"10-07","5:27","thousand times okay this is a used to represent represent the one thousandth"
"10-07","5:32","purple color pixels this is called spatial coding we can so"
"10-07","5:38","here you can see instead of using 1000 numbers we can use only two numbers to represent that right so this saves the"
"10-07","5:45","space or this saves the number of bits used to include the image a lot this is"
"10-07","5:52","one type a certain type of encoding is called temporal coding so temporal"
"10-07","5:58","coding means instead of sending a complete frame at I plus one for example"
"10-07","6:05","we have frame I and frame I plus one they have very very minor differences"
"10-07","6:12","you cannot even notice that right so then in this case we do not is we do not"
"10-07","6:18","need to send the entire frame I plus one instead of sending this complete frame"
"10-07","6:24","at I plus one we send only the differences from frame I this can save a"
"10-07","6:30","lot of bits so those are the two coding examples"
"10-07","6:37","and for video we also have constant bitrate and the variable bitrate constantly bit rate means the video"
"10-07","6:43","encoding rate is fixed it never change but variable bitrate means that we do including rate changes as amount of"
"10-07","6:50","spatial temporal coding changes so the next thing we are going to discuss is"
"10-07","6:55","how can we stream the videos to the users okay how can we do the video"
"10-07","7:01","streaming so this is a very simple scenario in this scenario we have a video server"
"10-07","7:07","the video server has the video stored on it and then we have the internet we have"
"10-07","7:13","the clients so our goal is we want to stream the video to the clients okay how"
"10-07","7:19","can we do that can we use one big server Big Mac server to connect to"
"10-07","7:26","all the clients that's not a good idea right you usually okay usually what we do is"
"10-07","7:33","actually uh we use something called content distribution Network okay so I"
"10-07","7:38","I'll talk about that later but for now let's talk about the mechanism of"
"10-07","7:43","streaming when they do the streaming one very effective way is to use Dash Okay"
"10-07","7:49","what is Dash that is a dynamic adaptive streaming"
"10-07","7:56","over HTTP that means the basic protocol is hcp then on top of HTTP we can do"
"10-07","8:04","some Dynamic and adaptive streaming okay how can we do that at the server side"
"10-07","8:13","at the server side the file the video file is divided into"
"10-07","8:19","multiple accounts it's not one complete piece of video it's actually multiple"
"10-07","8:25","chunks each chunk is stored and encoded at different rates"
"10-07","8:31","different risk means it may be faster it may be slower okay which means if it has"
"10-07","8:40","a higher rate than the video quality is usually higher because you can the"
"10-07","8:46","videos the images can be displayed at the higher speed right so the video"
"10-07","8:52","quality is usually better if you have a lower rate than the video quality is"
"10-07","8:57","usually poor and then there is one file called manifest file"
"10-07","9:04","this file will provide the URLs for different chunks"
"10-07","9:09","okay different charts at the client side the client"
"10-07","9:15","periodically matters the server to client bandwidth it will measure the benefit and say oh"
"10-07","9:21","my benefit is very good right now or all my bandwidth is not so good okay"
"10-07","9:27","depending on the bandwidth the client will Consulting the Manifest file"
"10-07","9:33","request one chunk at a one time"
"10-07","9:39","and also choose the maximum coding rate sustainable given the current database"
"10-07","9:48","so that means if my bandwidth is very good right now I can choose a"
"10-07","9:55","file chunk or video chunk with higher rate if my bandwidth is not so good then I"
"10-07","10:02","can choose a chunk with lower rate so the client can choose different"
"10-07","10:09","coding risks at different points in time okay the read may change depending"
"10-07","10:15","because the bandwidth may change right so then the reads maintain that's why when you watch the video sometimes you"
"10-07","10:21","can see oh the video quality is really good but sometimes it becomes a little bit blurry okay so that's because it is"
"10-07","10:29","dynamically changing the risk of the video okay all the reads of the file"
"10-07","10:36","chunk and if you think about this uh mechanism that you will realize"
"10-07","10:43","the intelligence is actually at the client side it's not at the server side"
"10-07","10:50","that means the client determines when to request the chunk"
"10-07","10:56","okay so that we don't won't have the buffer starvation or overflow"
"10-07","11:01","and kind will determine what encoding retro request based on the bandwidth"
"10-07","11:07","available so it will always request the higher quality videos the higher quality"
"10-07","11:13","video chunks okay when more bandwidth are available"
"10-07","11:19","and client also determines where to request the chunk okay because as we said the Manifest"
"10-07","11:27","file will provide the URLs for different chunks and then the client can check"
"10-07","11:34","this manifest file and decide oh this server this URL server is"
"10-07","11:39","probably closer to me so I want to request my file from that server okay so"
"10-07","11:46","the client is making um in the decision based on the Manifest file or This Server if this server has a"
"10-07","11:53","higher bandwidth okay then I can request from this server you can see the client"
"10-07","11:58","has the intelligence pay attention to this this may become a test problem okay I may ask you"
"10-07","12:07","who has the intelligence in dash who is deciding one what and where"
"10-07","12:13","in the dash so you need to know it's actually the client it's not the server"
"10-07","12:19","so then now let's go back to talk about the two challenges the one challenge is"
"10-07","12:24","how can we stream the content to hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users"
"10-07","12:29","option one is we can use one single large map server but as I mentioned you"
"10-07","12:35","may say seller problems firstly single point of failure if this server is done then"
"10-07","12:40","this entire application is done nobody can get videos right so second point of network condition okay this server may"
"10-07","12:48","be too busy there are too much traffic coming to this server right so this is"
"10-07","12:53","uh this may cause the network congestion and then the long path to decent clients"
"10-07","12:59","so if you put this server in us then how about the users from Europe from Asia"
"10-07","13:07","right how can they connect to this server okay their response time may be"
"10-07","13:13","too long and also multiple copies of video sent over the other Clinic these"
"10-07","13:18","are all the problems associated with the one Mega server so then the Explorer is"
"10-07","13:26","okay this doesn't scale how can we address this issue now as I said we will use something called"
"10-07","13:33","content distribution Network to address that issue then the option two is we can store or serve the multiple"
"10-07","13:42","copies of videos at multiple geographically distributed sites this is called the content distribution Network"
"10-07","13:49","so for Content Distributing Network there are usually two modes one mode is called enter deep enter deep means"
"10-07","13:57","so basically first you need to understand that the content dictionary network is basically a bunch of servers"
"10-07","14:03","okay a bunch of servers which store and also serve the multiple copies of videos"
"10-07","14:09","and they are distributed at different locations different geographical uh"
"10-07","14:14","geography locations right then in this case in this case for enter deep"
"10-07","14:20","basically means we push those servers deep into many access Networks do you"
"10-07","14:28","still remember access Networks we have for example"
"10-07","14:36","residential Networks"
"10-07","14:46","you still Channel networks and mobile networks right those are all the access networks so we can push the servers into"
"10-07","14:53","those exact Network for example we may have some kind of contribution Network server"
"10-07","15:00","in a campus that's exact State we may have CDN server on on the sensitive"
"10-07","15:07","campus so this is closer to close to the users then the user can get the videos"
"10-07","15:14","faster this is one mode another mode is instead of pushing those servers into"
"10-07","15:20","into the access networks we actually put those servers put a smaller number of"
"10-07","15:29","larger clusters in the ixps which are"
"10-07","15:35","internet exchange points near the access networks but they are not with the indu"
"10-07","15:41","access networks okay so those are the two modes that may be used enter deep and bring home"
"10-07","15:47","okay so right now let's look at this one example in this example I I try to show"
"10-07","15:53","you how the CDN Works let's say um CDN scenario restore copies of"
"10-07","15:59","content addresses and notes right so each CDN node is one is a obsidian server or a bunch of servers"
"10-07","16:06","then you can see now we have we have this uh CDN Network those servers they"
"10-07","16:14","all store a copy of a magnet okay this is a one one video and if this clients"
"10-07","16:23","when they want to watch this video Madman this"
"10-07","16:29","client will ask the server where is Madman then the Netflix server"
"10-07","16:36","will reply with a manifest file telling this kind hey the Minima is"
"10-07","16:42","available here and there so it's telling the URLs then the client may decide oh"
"10-07","16:47","okay this server is very close to me so I want to request management from this"
"10-07","16:52","server okay when I see close it doesn't necessarily mean"
"10-07","16:58","geographically close it may mean it's the response time is shorter which"
"10-07","17:05","means oh okay this this path is not so it's not uh very congested or not very"
"10-07","17:11","busy so I can get to the video faster all these benefits is higher than the"
"10-07","17:17","other path so it really depends um this is the general idea for the CDN"
"10-07","17:23","if of course one path Network part is congested then the uh subscriber or the"
"10-07","17:30","user can decide to choose a different copy from a different server"
"10-07","17:36","all right so that is the general idea now let's take a closer look of the CDN"
"10-07","17:42","pay attention many companies many video providers they have their own"
"10-07","17:50","recipients they have own CDLs to distribute the content especially for large companies"
"10-07","17:57","because they have the power they have the money to do this right but for some small providers for small video"
"10-07","18:04","companies they may not they may not have the CDN Network they may not have the"
"10-07","18:11","infrastructure in this case they may use some third-party cdns to provide the service"
"10-07","18:19","for example here we have one company called netcinema.com"
"10-07","18:24","this netsimo.com does not have the CDN Network so that's"
"10-07","18:31","why it is actually using the service the CDN service"
"10-07","18:36","from a third-party provider called kingcdn.com which means the videos are actually"
"10-07","18:43","stored on kingcdn.com is not stored on now cinema.com"
"10-07","18:49","okay the contents are stored in kingcdn.com now in this case this becomes a little"
"10-07","18:56","bit complicated because when the user is making requests"
"10-07","19:01","so for example client Bob is making requests it is actually requesting"
"10-07","19:06","directly from netcinema.com okay he said oh okay I want to watch"
"10-07","19:12","this video but the video is not stored intimate.com actually it is actually stored in"
"10-07","19:19","another URL it's stored in the CDN provider"
"10-07","19:24","kingzickian.com then in this case how can Bob reach the"
"10-07","19:30","Kings again.com okay let's look at the process the process is like this"
"10-07","19:35","firstly Bob will get the URL for the video now cinema.com 6y something from"
"10-07","19:42","the nasima.com webpage and then Bob will need to contact"
"10-07","19:49","contact Bob's local DNS server to resolve this URL"
"10-07","19:55","because this is a this URL is just telling the host name Etc it doesn't"
"10-07","20:00","tell the IP address right if you have watched the video in the uh DNS part"
"10-07","20:08","then you will know okay we need to translate this into IP address right so"
"10-07","20:14","that in this case in this case Bob's local DS server need to resolve this URL so usually what"
"10-07","20:23","happens if you remember what happened in the in the DNS part you will know Bob"
"10-07","20:28","the look of the ass may contact the root and then contact the TLD"
"10-07","20:36","which is a.com and then final contact"
"10-07","20:49","the final account has authoritative DS right so which is the net Cinema"
"10-07","20:59","so it is actually doing something else right so contact with may contact route"
"10-07","21:05","may contact TLD but um sometimes these gaps this this steps"
"10-07","21:11","may be skipped okay but eventually it will need to contact the authoritative"
"10-07","21:16","yes which is actually this one which is actually this one so and this"
"10-07","21:24","this step is very interesting so after above the local audience contact enough"
"10-07","21:30","Cinemas the authoritative Dance The Authority within us"
"10-07","21:35","normally it should return an IP address right but in this case this DNS will not"
"10-07","21:43","return an IP address it will return another URL why because it knows it"
"10-07","21:53","knows the video is not on that Cinema it is actually on key incident so that's"
"10-07","21:59","why it is actually returning another URL to redirect the Bob to kingcdn.com so"
"10-07","22:06","then after this local DS receives this then it will help to contact this kcdn's"
"10-07","22:15","authoritative DNS eventually to resolve this URL the new URL"
"10-07","22:20","of course before this it may contact the rule to make TRD Etc right so it may or may not show it"
"10-07","22:28","uh contact those ones and then finally finally can CDN will"
"10-07","22:35","return the IP address for this URL to both the local DS and then above the"
"10-07","22:41","local DNS will reply this back to what and finally Bob now know the IP address"
"10-07","22:47","for that URL so Bob will contact that one contact this one which has the video on"
"10-07","22:54","on it okay so then it will require the video from the King scan server and the"
"10-07","22:59","video will be streamed via ATP so you can see in this case in this case"
"10-07","23:05","we are using something called redirect DNS redirect okay so DNS is used to"
"10-07","23:12","redirect the client from the original server to the"
"10-07","23:17","real content distribution Network server okay that is very important pay"
"10-07","23:23","attention to that and leave me this may appear on the test so this is another example of Netflix in"
"10-07","23:31","Netflix in Netflix uh Netflix is actually using Amazon Cloud"
"10-07","23:38","to store the videos okay store the original copy of the"
"10-07","23:43","videos and also um the Manifest files so basically you"
"10-07","23:48","can see for the clients the clients need to firstly contact Netflix the registration and accounting servers okay"
"10-07","23:56","to get a Netflix account this is step one and in step two"
"10-07","24:02","but we all browse Netflix videos and then request for the Manifest file"
"10-07","24:08","so the Manifest file is returned for the request in the video after that after that you can see"
"10-07","24:16","actually those videos are already uploaded to the CDN servers"
"10-07","24:22","okay the student servers which are distributed in different locations then"
"10-07","24:28","based on the Manifest file the client Bob will check which one is the closer"
"10-07","24:34","one and then start the dash streaming with the CDN server so this is the"
"10-07","24:40","entire process Amazon Cloud is studying the videos and uploading those videos to CDN servers and Cloud will also return"
"10-07","24:48","the Manifest file to the to the client okay the client is only doing the"
"10-07","24:53","account registration and management with the Netflix servers so the next one is YouTube YouTube is"
"10-07","25:01","actually using a pulling cache which means the client is pulling the"
"10-07","25:07","um videos from the server and it is also using the DS redirect which means DNS is"
"10-07","25:15","used to redirect the client to the cluster which the rtt is the lowest rtt"
"10-07","25:21","we know this is the round trip time which is uh which means the response"
"10-07","25:26","time is the lowest which which means it can respond to the users faster okay so"
"10-07","25:32","I hope you still remember what his DNS redirect this is what we just discussed here the DNS redirect"
"10-07","25:39","all right the NASA one the last application is cancan okay kanken is"
"10-07","25:46","also a very interesting one you probably haven't heard about this before but can can is a very popular application used"
"10-07","25:54","in China for watching the videos basically 10 is using a hybrid model"
"10-07","26:01","what does this mean we know for client server model we need to pay for the"
"10-07","26:06","server hardware and also the bandwidth right the bandwidth the server uses to"
"10-07","26:11","distribute the videos this may be very costly very costly okay"
"10-07","26:17","if you want to satisfy all the demand from all the users right you have to"
"10-07","26:22","deploy a lot of servers and have a lot of bandwidth distributed videos that's"
"10-07","26:28","why uh kenkey is actually using a P2P model or we call it a hybrid CDN and P2P"
"10-07","26:36","model so what does this mean this means when the clients make the"
"10-07","26:41","initial request the client requested the beginning of the content from the CDN"
"10-07","26:46","servers if it was freshly start with the server and then in parallel thus this uh client"
"10-07","26:54","will also request the content from the peers we just talk about P2P right it"
"10-07","26:59","will also request the company from the peers when the P2P traffic is sufficient"
"10-07","27:06","which means if the peers can already satisfy"
"10-07","27:12","the the request from the uh from the client then the client will not rely on"
"10-07","27:19","the server anymore the client will seize the streaming from the CDN servers and"
"10-07","27:25","only stream from the peers only when the P2P traffic becomes insufficient then in"
"10-07","27:32","this case the client will restart the CDN connections and connect with the the server to get the"
"10-07","27:40","the video from the server okay and return to the mode of a hybrid CDN P2P"
"10-07","27:46","streaming so it's like for example for our class you will if you have a problem to resolve you will firstly contact me"
"10-07","27:54","at the same time you will also contact your classmates and if you can already resolve this"
"10-07","28:00","problem from your classmates then you don't need any help from me only when"
"10-07","28:06","you think oh they cannot help meet me okay they cannot satisfy my request then"
"10-07","28:11","in this case you can start contacting with me again say hey can you help me"
"10-07","28:17","with this problem then in this case you return to the mode of hybrid City and P2P streaming so in this case you can"
"10-07","28:24","say uh client server model is like more like a backup or P2P"
"10-07","28:29","but one very interesting observation I had before when I use the canker is"
"10-07","28:35","whenever I start camping then my computer becomes super busy a super a"
"10-07","28:43","temperature become becomes super higher high and then it becomes super slow the"
"10-07","28:49","reason is because for p2pu you think about this the P2P application You are"
"10-07","28:55","downloading and you are also uploading you are making requests you are also"
"10-07","29:00","actually serving others so that's why it uses a lot of the CPU and also bandwidth"
"10-07","29:07","okay that's why your computer can become super busy uh and it may sometimes"
"10-07","29:13","because it is occupied too much resources sometimes it may block the other applications okay the other"
"10-07","29:19","application may not get enough resources to to work that's why you feel like your"
"10-07","29:25","computer is getting slow it's it's not response responding anymore okay things"
"10-07","29:30","like that yeah so that's all about the video streaming and the content distribute"
"10-07","29:36","Network foreign"
"10-10","0:03","foreign"
"10-10","0:14","chapters the first chapter we studied the principles of the networking and we"
"10-10","0:20","learned about the different layers the second chapter is about application layer so we learned about the application like"
"10-10","0:28","emails web services videos Etc the chapter 3 then is going to be a layer"
"10-10","0:35","below which is a transport layer okay and we know from what we have learned"
"10-10","0:40","before we know transport layer is actually providing services to the app layer to the application layer okay and"
"10-10","0:48","in this chapter we are going to learn in detail about those Services okay"
"10-10","0:54","so basically we will try to to talk about the multiplexing the"
"10-10","0:59","multiplexing uh how we do the reliability transfer we mentioned in TCP"
"10-10","1:05","TCP is a reliable protocol right so then we will Design our own reliability"
"10-10","1:13","transfer protocol from scratch and tell you the principles why we do that why we"
"10-10","1:20","do this okay so it's like that um then after that we will talk about the"
"10-10","1:26","protocols that we use in reality including the UDP and TCP okay"
"10-10","1:32","so let's review the transport layer Services um the transparently here basically"
"10-10","1:40","provides the logical communication between"
"10-10","1:45","application processes running on different Halls those still remember a"
"10-10","1:51","long time ago I mentioned when we see communication to communication we always say oh computer a is communicating to"
"10-10","1:57","computer B but that is not accurate right we should say process a or process one"
"10-10","2:06","is communicating with process two okay process one on computer a is coming"
"10-10","2:12","communicating with process 2 on computer B okay that's how we should say"
"10-10","2:19","um the communication um so basically what the transport layer"
"10-10","2:26","protocol do is at the center side uh the transport layer will break the"
"10-10","2:31","application layer message into smaller segments and then pass them down below"
"10-10","2:38","to the network layer"
"10-10","2:45","so we now add application layer we are sending out a message like HTTP message"
"10-10","2:51","HP request message ATV Rush long message email messages right so we look we call"
"10-10","2:58","them as messages application layer then when it goes down to transport layer the"
"10-10","3:03","messages need to be divided into smaller units we call them"
"10-10","3:09","as segments okay and if you still remember what we"
"10-10","3:17","will do is we add headers we add transport layer headers"
"10-10","3:22","to each segment and then pass them to the layer below"
"10-10","3:27","so that is at the center side at the receiver side the receiver will reassemble"
"10-10","3:35","reassemble those segments into a message and pass that to the layer above which"
"10-10","3:41","is the application layer okay and in the transport layer the common"
"10-10","3:48","protocols we use Arc TCP and UDP okay"
"10-10","3:55","so some of you may get confused about transport layer and network layer so you may think oh if I know Network layer is"
"10-10","4:02","for routine then why do I need a transport layer okay so yes that's"
"10-10","4:08","correct Network layer is can do the routing but the routing the communication is between cost okay so"
"10-10","4:16","it's like when you deliver a package okay uh Oman you write a letter"
"10-10","4:21","then the postman will simply drop this letter to"
"10-10","4:27","the uh for all this package to your house or to your friend's house right so"
"10-10","4:33","it's like that it's like a half speed half speed and house communication"
"10-10","4:39","but as we said the communication needs to happen really happen in processes"
"10-10","4:44","okay between processes um so we need for example my Firefox is"
"10-10","4:51","communicating with the Apache on the server okay it's one my person Firefox"
"10-10","4:59","process when it is running it's not called application anymore it's called a process what this process is"
"10-10","5:06","communicating with another server process at the Apache server so it's the"
"10-10","5:11","communication should happen between process and process and on my computer I may have a lot of processes not just the"
"10-10","5:19","Firefox I may also have my email running right I may also have other applications"
"10-10","5:25","running like video games maybe I'm playing video games right so a lot of processes then we need to specify which"
"10-10","5:34","process you are talking to okay or which process is communicating"
"10-10","5:40","so then within this house we have multiple processes it's like when you deliver a package okay you need to know"
"10-10","5:48","you need to say oh I'm delivering this package to somebody to to some person this specific"
"10-10","5:56","person in that house in that address okay so it's like that"
"10-10","6:02","you can see we have an analogy on the right side uh it's a household analogy"
"10-10","6:08","so travel case the end house is sending letters to tell kids uh in Bill's house"
"10-10","6:16","okay so basically here we know the houses are like the host okay and the"
"10-10","6:22","kids are like the processes okay so then the letters in the envelope are like the"
"10-10","6:28","application messages then the transported layer protocol is like"
"10-10","6:33","the app and the host n and Bo Will D Max D multiplexing"
"10-10","6:40","uh the letters to the in-house siblings okay and then the network layer protocol"
"10-10","6:46","is like the Postal Service okay so you can say the transpose layered protocol"
"10-10","6:52","is actually happening within this person within this horse"
"10-10","6:58","okay with in-house and the network layer protocol is happening uh for this entire network"
"10-10","7:05","okay uh now let's look at"
"10-10","7:11","um the two type of protocols one is TCP and unwind codp and we have mentioned"
"10-10","7:16","this for many times but I'm sure you have already forgot everything okay"
"10-10","7:22","um so basically TCP is a reliable protocol it will do reliable in order"
"10-10","7:30","delivery um so TCP can provide services like"
"10-10","7:35","congestion control flow control and connection setup it requires connection"
"10-10","7:42","setup okay I have mentioned before what is congestion tone what is flow control"
"10-10","7:47","I hope you still remember because that may be a test question okay I may ask"
"10-10","7:53","you what is the difference between flow control and congestion control you should know that okay"
"10-10","7:58","so let me remind you again flow control means we don't want to overwhelm the"
"10-10","8:04","receiver foreign"
"10-10","8:18","the receiver um it's like you don't want to call your friend again again and again"
"10-10","8:24","okay so or or if you're sending things too fast he cannot process then you are"
"10-10","8:31","overrunning your receiver so that is the flow control"
"10-10","8:48","congestion control means not to overwhelm the public network"
"10-10","8:54","okay not to overwhelm the public network that means if I know the network is"
"10-10","9:00","already congested okay then I won't send the package out or I will control my"
"10-10","9:06","speed and sending the packets out slowly so it's like that that's the major"
"10-10","9:11","difference between flow control and congestion control okay so the second protocol is called UDP UDP"
"10-10","9:20","is an unreliable protocol it will do unordered delivery"
"10-10","9:28","okay it doesn't do flow control it doesn't do congestion control nothing okay"
"10-10","9:35","um and it does not require connection setup okay for both type of protocols TCP and"
"10-10","9:43","UDP they do not guarantee the delays and they do not guarantee the bandwidth okay"
"10-10","9:50","both services do not provide this um"
"10-10","9:55","okay so that is the overview of the transport layer now let's talk about multiplexing and"
"10-10","10:01","d-mark D multiplexer you heard about that right I talked about that so multiplexing basically means we"
"10-10","10:09","handle the data from uh the sender side okay we handle data from multiple"
"10-10","10:16","sockets and transform the header that is called the mod flexing and then D"
"10-10","10:21","multiplexing is means at the receiver side when we receive the package we have"
"10-10","10:27","to assign them to different receiving processes or receiving ports okay so"
"10-10","10:34","that is called the demultiplexing so if we use the Postal Service analogy again"
"10-10","10:40","then multiplexing is like at the center side okay for example your parent is"
"10-10","10:47","collecting all the letters from your house okay from your sibling from uh"
"10-10","10:53","everybody okay and then click them together and then put them into uh the"
"10-10","11:00","outgoing mailbox okay that's the multiplexing and then D"
"10-10","11:06","multiplexing is like one for example when the receiver when your friends"
"10-10","11:11","parents okay receives a lot of letters for different people then they will"
"10-10","11:17","check the packet the letter the letter uh envelope"
"10-10","11:22","and then assign these letters to different people in the house so that is"
"10-10","11:30","the multiplexing so and now you can see we have two computers communicating uh"
"10-10","11:36","with the server buildings machine as a server um and now you can see this"
"10-10","11:43","P3 is communicating with the P1 they are processing P1 P2 P2 P4 are all processes"
"10-10","11:49","so P2 is communicating with P4 okay so it's like that and now let's uh"
"10-10","11:57","this is if this gives you like a overview of uh multiplexing and D"
"10-10","12:03","multiplexing but we actually have uh two types of multiplexing and D multiplexing"
"10-10","12:09","we are going to talk about this later okay so now let's look at firstly how"
"10-10","12:14","the D multiplexing works okay as I said the marketplace is like a sun in the"
"10-10","12:20","laterals to different people in the house right so how does this work basically the horse receives IP"
"10-10","12:27","datagrams okay each datagram so here"
"10-10","12:33","IP datagram basically means uh it's a network layer thing okay and network"
"10-10","12:40","layer we in do you remember at application layer we call it a message at the transport layer"
"10-10","12:47","we call it a segment right then at Network layer we give a different name"
"10-10","12:52","it's called IP datagram okay so now you can view an iptogram as a"
"10-10","12:58","letter when the host receive a letter one of the hosts receive our IP datagram okay"
"10-10","13:04","from the network layer then each datagram has the source IP address and"
"10-10","13:10","destination IP address it's like when you when you receive a letter on the letter you will see the source address"
"10-10","13:16","and destination address so from this address to that address okay"
"10-10","13:22","and also each datagram carries one transport layer segment"
"10-10","13:29","okay so it's like this"
"10-10","13:55","and when you receive an IP in the ground it looks like this firstly"
"10-10","14:03","it has a higher IP layer header okay in IP layer header or network layer"
"10-10","14:11","header you can see the source IP and destination IP okay and then within this"
"10-10","14:32","within this it carries it carries a TCP or UDP segment"
"10-10","14:39","okay so basically we can use the source IP and Destiny IP to to identify oh this"
"10-10","14:45","is to this computer or that computer okay so like we are using the soft stress areas and Destiny address to"
"10-10","14:51","identify the address for the house okay then within this within this diagram it"
"10-10","14:58","carries something then something is called TCP or UDP segment it's like"
"10-10","15:04","um um so so this segment is like this is"
"10-10","15:10","okay this is the TCP ODP settlement format so you can say"
"10-10","15:16","add to the"
"10-10","15:23","this part is called the transport layer header"
"10-10","15:35","okay in the transport layer header then you can see what the soft spot"
"10-10","15:41","and destination part okay Source port and dashing reports are"
"10-10","15:46","like the names on the letters okay it's like my call for address a or Draw now for"
"10-10","15:55","address B okay it's like that so The Source Point number and the Singapore number are like"
"10-10","16:02","the names on the letters So based on the Pod numbers you are able to know oh this"
"10-10","16:07","goes to process a oh that goes to process B so basically"
"10-10","16:12","the house will use the IP addresses and phone numbers to"
"10-10","16:19","direct segments to the appropriate socket okay this is a what we do"
"10-10","16:25","this is how the D multiplexing works okay so if you look if you think about"
"10-10","16:31","the entire process it's basically uh do you remember the five layers"
"10-10","16:38","send aside receiver side they all have five layers and we said the message is"
"10-10","16:44","going to be breaking into smaller segments and we will add headers to the smaller"
"10-10","16:51","segments and then it's passed to the lower layer and then"
"10-10","16:56","we will again add headers"
"10-10","17:06","to each segment right"
"10-10","17:15","okay and it has three seven and then pass them to the receiver"
"10-10","17:21","okay and the receiver sign the receiver will receive something like this"
"10-10","17:26","okay at the network layer and network layer They will receive something like the datagram"
"10-10","17:33","okay and then they will read The Source IP destination IP and check the source portion decision port and then pass them"
"10-10","17:40","to the up layer so I I want to put this into the big"
"10-10","17:45","picture so you kind of know what is happening okay now let's look at the"
"10-10","17:51","connectionally steam multiplexing which is corresponding to UDP why do we call it connections because we"
"10-10","17:59","know for UDP we do not need to establish any connection that's why we call it connectionless okay if you recall what"
"10-10","18:08","we have learned in the soccer program assignment we basically whenever we want to uh"
"10-10","18:16","start a communication as the client side especially okay so we need to create a"
"10-10","18:21","socket first and this socket will have a local port number"
"10-10","18:27","okay so for example here datagram socket"
"10-10","18:33","my socket 1 equals to new socket and we give it a phone number"
"10-10","18:39","when creating the datagram to send into the UDP socket we must also specify"
"10-10","18:46","the destination IP address and the Singapore number do you remember that okay reset for UDP we must specify the"
"10-10","18:54","destination ipn Port but for TCP we do not need to do that right because a"
"10-10","18:59","Channel or has already been established okay so then when the house receive the UDP"
"10-10","19:07","segment the host will at the receiver side the host the receiver will check the destination port in the segment and"
"10-10","19:15","direct the UDP segment to the circuit with that port"
"10-10","19:21","okay that means the uip datagrams with with the same decision Point number"
"10-10","19:28","but different Source IP addresses or Source Point numbers will be directed to"
"10-10","19:34","the same socket as a destination so what does this mean this means no matter this"
"10-10","19:41","package no matter where this package comes from as long as they have the same"
"10-10","19:47","destination port then there will be sent to the same socket"
"10-10","19:54","okay let's look at an example in this example"
"10-10","19:59","we have again one server and two clients okay"
"10-10","20:04","P1 process P1 is communicating with P3 and P4"
"10-10","20:11","so now at the client side we need to create a new socket with socket number"
"10-10","20:16","9157 and then add the other client side we"
"10-10","20:22","also need to create a new socket 5774 at the server side it will create a new"
"10-10","20:27","socket which has port number 6428 thank you"
"10-10","20:33","Peter is sending a packet or we required a segment"
"10-10","20:39","to the server with Source part 9157 and this report four six four two"
"10-10","20:48","eight and we know now this segment will be sent to"
"10-10","20:53","the socket of P1 right"
"10-10","20:59","and then this this P1 will reply back with Source Port 6428 and Destiny report"
"10-10","21:06","91557 for the the other side to the same thing"
"10-10","21:13","okay so can you guess here what is the saucepot and what is the"
"10-10","21:19","destination port so now you notice the one thing because"
"10-10","21:24","this packet and this packet they share the same destination Port sorry not this"
"10-10","21:31","one no this one this one this set this share the same doesn't import and then they"
"10-10","21:37","will be sent to the same socket oh P1 no matter where they come from although"
"10-10","21:44","they have you can say they have different they have different soft spots but still"
"10-10","21:49","they will be sent to the same socket okay this is called connectionless"
"10-10","21:55","demultiplexing okay the second type is called connection"
"10-10","22:00","oriented multiplexing and this is specially for TCP"
"10-10","22:06","this one is different from that the one of UDP okay so in TCP"
"10-10","22:16","um the socket is identified by four Tuple"
"10-10","22:22","by a four Tuple which contains Source IP address Source Point number destination"
"10-10","22:28","IP address and decision post number so when we receive a package or a"
"10-10","22:35","segment whatever you call it okay the receiver will use all the four values to"
"10-10","22:41","direct the segment to the appropriate socket that means if any value"
"10-10","22:48","for these four values if any one is different then the packet will be"
"10-10","22:54","directed into a different socket okay so that is uh the connection"
"10-10","23:01","oriented um and several Hearts May support many"
"10-10","23:06","simultaneous TCP sockets each socket identified by its own four people that's a"
"10-10","23:11","um for that product we know right for web servers web servers have different"
"10-10","23:17","sockets for each connecting client the non-processing HTTP will have a different socket for each request okay"
"10-10","23:25","so now let's look at an example an example again clients"
"10-10","23:31","a okay and server B"
"10-10","23:37","then client C so uh we also use ABC to represent IP addresses for this horse"
"10-10","23:44","okay so now let's look at um let's look at the um"
"10-10","23:51","server part first the server here now how through processes P4 P5 and P6"
"10-10","23:59","the client side has a P1 P2 P3 okay"
"10-10","24:05","and now I want you to look at um"
"10-10","24:10","this one first okay for this one the source IP is"
"10-10","24:17","B and the source Port is 80. the destination IP is a and that's not"
"10-10","24:24","import is nine five one seven sorry 9157"
"10-10","24:31","okay and this one is"
"10-10","24:38","80. call number 80. this one also has port number 80."
"10-10","24:47","and this one also had Pawn number 80. this one has port number of"
"10-10","24:53","five seven seven five"
"10-10","24:59","okay so I'm marking the phone numbers some of you may say oh why does p 45 P6"
"10-10","25:07","has the same port we will explain this later okay for now"
"10-10","25:13","I want to I want you to look at these three this one"
"10-10","25:18","okay this one and also this one look at these three"
"10-10","25:24","packets these three segments and check their Source IP and Source"
"10-10","25:30","Port are they the same their Source IP and Source port"
"10-10","25:37","are they the same for all these three foreign"
"10-10","25:45","sport as you can see they are different they're different right they are not the"
"10-10","25:51","same okay but if you check destination IP and destination Port are they the same"
"10-10","26:00","they all have the same destination report definite destination IP okay"
"10-10","26:07","and if we are using nationalists the multiplexing if we share the same"
"10-10","26:13","destination IP and the same destination port they will be directed to the same socket"
"10-10","26:18","which is a the socket for P1 right but here as you can see although these three"
"10-10","26:26","packets let's call them number one number two and number three although"
"10-10","26:32","number one two three they all have the same destination IP and decision Port they are assigned to different sockets"
"10-10","26:43","do you see for example number one goes to the socket for P4 number two goes to"
"10-10","26:49","the socket for P6 number three goes to socket for P5 why as we said before in TCP we will check"
"10-10","26:59","all four values okay if any value is different then they"
"10-10","27:05","will be assigned to a different socket okay and especially for two and three"
"10-10","27:11","you can see although they come from the same machine they all come from C"
"10-10","27:17","okay but because we come from different processes they feel that they have a"
"10-10","27:23","different Source Point numbers okay two has five seven seven five and seven has"
"10-10","27:29","nine one five seven because their point number sourceful numbers are different then they have still they have to be"
"10-10","27:35","assigned to different sockets and the server side"
"10-10","27:41","okay this is something you need to pay attention uh that is actually the feature of"
"10-10","27:46","connection oriented the multiplexing so in reality in reality if P4 P5 and P6"
"10-10","27:54","they share the same port numbers okay we do not call them as different"
"10-10","28:00","processes we call them as different threads of the same process okay so in"
"10-10","28:09","reality in our reality P4 P5 P6 they are just a one process"
"10-10","28:16","okay one process we call it P4 for example but this process may share"
"10-10","28:22","different may have different sockets they have multiple sockets okay and for"
"10-10","28:29","this for this kind of threshold we call it threaded server that means in this"
"10-10","28:34","case um we can deal with multiple clients"
"10-10","28:39","requests at the same time okay with one process but multiple"
"10-10","28:46","threads okay multiple service and if you you have already taken 139 or if you are"
"10-10","28:53","going to take 139 you keep that in mind you are either learn the relationship between threats and processes"
"10-10","29:01","next let's talk about a little bit about the UDP okay connectionless transport"
"10-10","29:06","UDP so again UDP protocol is just a best"
"10-10","29:11","service best effort protocol okay so it will try it best to do the work it"
"10-10","29:18","doesn't care about the loss the reliability okay so it may"
"10-10","29:23","may lose data it may deliver the data out of order okay and also its"
"10-10","29:30","connection is we do not need to do any handshaking between the sender and receiver"
"10-10","29:35","each EDP segment is handled independently of the others okay so"
"10-10","29:42","UDP can be used to um for example do the"
"10-10","29:48","streaming mod media because we know multimedia can tolerate the loss right"
"10-10","29:54","if we lose some pixels it doesn't really matter okay we can still see the entire picture"
"10-10","30:00","um and then it also it is also using other protocols like DNS we just learned DNS"
"10-10","30:06","right because it's very fast you do not need to accept the connection Etc so it's a so UDP is preferred we can also"
"10-10","30:15","do reliable transfer over UDP okay if you want but it's not because the UDP"
"10-10","30:23","itself has this functionality it's because you can add reliability at the"
"10-10","30:28","application layer okay so that means you can do the"
"10-10","30:34","um checking errors or checking reliabilities at an upper layer is not in within the transport lead okay so"
"10-10","30:41","that's something you can you should keep in mind and this is the uh UDP segment format"
"10-10","30:48","so basically if you write a letter or write an email okay uh the email message"
"10-10","30:55","as we said will be be cut into smaller pieces each piece is called a segment"
"10-10","31:02","it's like this okay but we need to add something called header to that segment"
"10-10","31:10","okay so the Header information will contain The Source Point number that's"
"10-10","31:16","an important number we learned this right the length of this entire UDP segment including the header and also"
"10-10","31:23","the checksum okay so then within the data part the"
"10-10","31:28","payload part is just the application layer data it's like if you write an email then all the email content will be"
"10-10","31:36","put in the payload part if you look at the header"
"10-10","31:41","okay each line is 30 to 32 bits which means four bytes"
"10-10","31:49","so the UDP header in total will be"
"10-10","31:58","advice so eight parts it's actually very short later we are going to learn uh TCP when"
"10-10","32:06","we learn TCP will investigate the TCP header is about 20 bytes"
"10-10","32:11","or 20 plus in more than 20 okay so the UDP header is much smaller"
"10-10","32:18","so some of you may ask if UDP does not provide any flow control"
"10-10","32:24","congestion control no connection and no reliability is guaranteed nothing now"
"10-10","32:30","why do we still use UDP okay we have multiple reasons number one reason we do"
"10-10","32:37","not need to establish connection between the center and receiver okay that seems"
"10-10","32:44","a lot of delay okay it saves delay that's number one that's very important sometimes we"
"10-10","32:50","really want it to be fast okay we don't want we don't want to add like the"
"10-10","32:56","connection time okay it takes time and second"
"10-10","33:01","so it's very simple no connection States at the center and the resume side is the"
"10-10","33:07","methane okay we we can just if you want to send you the same just specify the"
"10-10","33:12","destination and there's an important there's an IP important that's that's enough okay it's very simple"
"10-10","33:19","third the third point is that it has a very small header size"
"10-10","33:25","it has only eight bytes of header if you use TCP then it's going to be it's gonna"
"10-10","33:30","be 20 plus bytes okay so the header size is a bigger in"
"10-10","33:36","TCP that's why UDP is sometimes favored okay it seems the resources"
"10-10","33:43","and number four UDP does not provide any congestion control okay so it can Blast away as fast as"
"10-10","33:52","desired as long as um you want to send as long as you have"
"10-10","33:57","the data then you can go ahead to send data you don't need to worry about anything else okay so that those are all"
"10-10","34:03","the benefits of UDP and this may be a test question I may ask you what are the features of"
"10-10","34:10","UDP or what are the benefits of using UDP okay you should delete list at least one"
"10-10","34:18","um the last thing I want to talk about is the UDC UDP checksum so here you can see"
"10-10","34:24","the checksum what is checksum used for techsum is used to detect the errors"
"10-10","34:31","which are usually inflict bits in the transmitted segment so basically what"
"10-10","34:36","will happen is at the center side the center side will treat the segment"
"10-10","34:41","contents including the header fails as a sequence of 16 bit integers so we for"
"10-10","34:48","example we treat this one as one part and this one another part then every 16"
"10-10","34:54","bit every 16 bit is treated as one integer and then we do"
"10-10","35:01","the addition of the sacrament content okay we do the addition for this we call this Chuck sum okay and"
"10-10","35:09","then the center will put the checksum value here in the UDP"
"10-12","0:01","um the last thing I want to talk about is the UDC UDP checksum so here we can see"
"10-12","0:07","the checksum what is checksum used for techsum is used to detect the errors"
"10-12","0:13","which are usually the flipped bits in the transmitted segment so basically what will happen is at the center side"
"10-12","0:21","the center side will treat the segment contents including the header Fields as a"
"10-12","0:27","sequence of 16 bit integers so we for example we treat this one as one part"
"10-12","0:33","and this one another part then every 16 bit every 16 bit"
"10-12","0:40","is treated as one integer and then we do the addition of the segment content"
"10-12","0:46","okay we do the addition uh for this we call this checksum okay and then the"
"10-12","0:52","center will put the checksum value here in the UDP uh chuckson field"
"10-12","0:59","the receiver sign when the receiver receives the assignment it will compute the checksum of the received segment in"
"10-12","1:06","the same way in exactly the same way and check if the computed checksum"
"10-12","1:12","equals to the checks and field value if"
"10-12","1:18","if the are not the same that means error is"
"10-12","1:24","directed sorry error is detected if they are the same that means no error is"
"10-12","1:30","directed detected so basically we need to come the center side will calculate"
"10-12","1:35","one value put it into this field the receiver side will also do the same calculation and save the match if they"
"10-12","1:42","match no error if it doesn't match then we we can see there is error okay"
"10-12","1:49","so you may ask how do we do the checksum how do we do the editing uh now you can"
"10-12","1:54","see we have two 16-bit integers okay and it's very easy to do the add-in zero"
"10-12","2:00","plus one is one one plus zero one one plus one is zero and add one so this"
"10-12","2:07","becomes one you continue okay until you finish all the edit if"
"10-12","2:12","you have one more bit okay then you need to carry out this bit"
"10-12","2:19","from the most significant bit and put it to the to here"
"10-12","2:24","okay you move this one to here and then add one again okay then one plus one is"
"10-12","2:33","zero and add one and Z it becomes zero and then add one it becomes one okay so"
"10-12","2:40","that is called the sum and now the check sum means you flip the Beats okay so we"
"10-12","2:45","flip zero to one zero to one one two zero one two zero one two zero so it's like that okay this is how you calculate"
"10-12","2:52","the check sum uh this is a how to do the Eddie and"
"10-12","2:58","everything okay and basically the sender and the receiver will follow the same way to"
"10-12","3:03","calculate this checksum okay we will continue with the 3.4 principles of"
"10-12","3:10","reliable this transfer and let me tell you this part is very important"
"10-12","3:17","and it will definitely appear on the test so pay attention from now"
"10-12","3:24","um so basically in this section we are going to design a reliable data transfer"
"10-12","3:30","protocol from scratch okay so I can show you the principles of the designing and"
"10-12","3:36","you you will understand oh why I do this why I do that there are some reasons behind okay so basically for reliability"
"10-12","3:43","transfer our goal is we want to transfer the data"
"10-12","3:49","reliably okay um and this is very important in application transport and also link"
"10-12","3:56","layers this is the reliability transfer is the top 10 list um important"
"10-12","4:01","networking topics okay uh and what we are going to discuss"
"10-12","4:07","today is basically about how we are going to design such a protocol to make"
"10-12","4:14","sure we indeed have reliability transfer so now you can look at the figure on the"
"10-12","4:20","left and on the left you can see we have sending process on the right you can see the receiver process okay"
"10-12","4:27","um and then now we have a transport layer we know transport layer is going to provide a service to the application"
"10-12","4:34","layer okay and ideally if the transporter"
"10-12","4:39","layer has a reliable Channel okay that means all the data are sent through this reliable Channel"
"10-12","4:46","then no data will get lost right so this this is reliable we don't need to do anything else"
"10-12","4:53","it's like if our USPS is reliable completely reliable and you will never"
"10-12","5:00","lose any letters or packages okay but is that the truth"
"10-12","5:06","no right that is not the truth so your name"
"10-12","5:11","the channel itself is unreliable like USPS is unreliable okay similarly"
"10-12","5:18","networking is also unreliable you think about the links we are using like the wireless links the cables or even the"
"10-12","5:26","fiber the fibers although it has a very low error rate but this it still has errors okay uh Wi-Fi has a lot of Errors"
"10-12","5:35","I would say okay then with this kind of unreliable channels how can we achieve"
"10-12","5:42","the reliability that's the issue okay then what we will do in reality is okay"
"10-12","5:48","let's design some kind of data transfer protocol okay then the upper layer can just call"
"10-12","5:56","some reliability transfer protocol okay and say oh okay please send this"
"10-12","6:02","for me in a reliable way okay and then this protocol we are basically"
"10-12","6:09","Ensure everything is reliable okay by"
"10-12","6:15","calling some unreliable transfer functions"
"10-12","6:20","okay by using some unreliable channels okay so then"
"10-12","6:26","this is a this is uh what we will do in the real in the reliable data transfer"
"10-12","6:31","protocol so basically we will say okay for example I understand you I'll do"
"10-12","6:36","some packets uh it's fine but how are we gonna ensure the reliability we may say okay check it"
"10-12","6:43","again if it's it's lost then let's send it again right so using this way we can"
"10-12","6:49","ensure the reliability okay that's what we are going to do in the reliable this transfer protocol we"
"10-12","6:56","are going to design something like that to ensure the reliability okay so I'll just skip this part and at"
"10-12","7:03","the receiver receives receiver side you can see um they will call a relay relay position"
"10-12","7:09","for receive and then finally after all the receive uh data are received and"
"10-12","7:14","then we will deliver the data to the upper layer which is the application layer okay so I just skip that"
"10-12","7:21","all right so then what we will do is we will incrementally develop the sender"
"10-12","7:27","and receiver size of reliable this transfer protocol uh we consider we consider only unit"
"10-12","7:35","direction of this transfer okay that means the data is only from sender to"
"10-12","7:40","receiver but the control flow sorry the control uh information will flow on both"
"10-12","7:47","directions okay that means data is going one way but the control information can be sent back okay"
"10-12","7:53","all right let's look at rdt 1.0 rdt means reliability to transfer okay"
"10-12","7:59","version one we assume we are sending data over a"
"10-12","8:06","reliable Channel in this case the underlying channel is"
"10-12","8:11","perfectly reliable no bid errors no loss of packets okay when we say reliable or unreliable"
"10-12","8:18","We Will We Will mainly refer to these two aspects bit errors or loss of"
"10-12","8:23","packets okay and then in this case if we have a reliable Channel then do we need to do"
"10-12","8:29","anything no we don't need to do anything so this is RDP 1.0 you do nothing that's"
"10-12","8:36","very easy right very easy okay rdt 2.0 now let's assume the"
"10-12","8:43","channel has big errors okay pay attention we assume the channel has big"
"10-12","8:49","errors but no loss"
"10-12","8:58","okay we assume the channel can deliver all the packets but some packets may"
"10-12","9:04","have big hours okay with habit errors um so the underlying Channel may flip"
"10-12","9:13","bits because we have only zeros at once we let me have let me see bit arrows we basically mean"
"10-12","9:19","um zero becomes one one becomes zero right Philippines in the packet and then the question is how can we"
"10-12","9:25","detect the error how did how can we detect a bit error do"
"10-12","9:31","you still remember when we talk about the UDP"
"10-12","9:36","we talked about something called checksum you remember this"
"10-12","9:41","okay how do we deter that how do we detect errors we set at the center side"
"10-12","9:47","the center will calculate the traction basically treat a 60 treat every 16 bit"
"10-12","9:56","as a one integer and then add it integer together right so we calculate checksum and put the checksum into this field"
"10-12","10:05","okay take some fear then when this packet is received at the receiver side the receiver will calculate the checksum"
"10-12","10:12","again in the same way and then compare if that checksum is the"
"10-12","10:17","same as this taxum if they are the same we say no error okay if they are not the"
"10-12","10:25","same then we say oh some piece has been flipped there are errors do you remember"
"10-12","10:31","that okay so that's how we detect the errors okay how we detect the arrows but the"
"10-12","10:38","question is oh if we know there are some errors then"
"10-12","10:44","how can we recover from the arrows for human being how do we recover from"
"10-12","10:49","errors during a conversation for example if I say something wrong what do you do start over"
"10-12","10:55","start over right yes so you just signal me right you will signal me say hey professor said something wrong right and"
"10-12","11:03","then I will um correct that okay I'll I'll repeat"
"10-12","11:08","and translate so that is how we recover from error so let's look at what is"
"10-12","11:14","happening here so basically I will check some firstly to detect the bit errors and then we use"
"10-12","11:22","something called X acknowledgment ack"
"10-12","11:27","okay to express explicitly tells the center that the packet is received okay"
"10-12","11:34","but if this is not okay if the packet had arrows then we will directly see"
"10-12","11:40","negative acknowledgments k-o-n-a-k neck"
"10-12","11:46","okay and AK so the in this case the sender when it"
"10-12","11:53","receives naked it will re-transmit the packets"
"10-12","11:59","okay to correct the arrows so it's just a re-transmission of the packet"
"10-12","12:07","um so this is the rdt 2.0 we have a Channel with mid-bit"
"10-12","12:13","arrows but this 2.0 has a fatal flow what is the flow"
"10-12","12:19","the floor is basically what happens if a c k or nak is corrupted"
"10-12","12:26","so if this is corrupted then the center side doesn't know what has happened at"
"10-12","12:31","the receiver so what should the sender do should I retracement should I not you so if you do not"
"10-12","12:40","retransmit them maybe the receiver side has some errors right you cannot correct it but if you"
"10-12","12:46","decide to retransmit then you the receiver May re receive a duplicate"
"10-12","12:51","package so then how can we address that issue so basically in order to address"
"10-12","12:57","that duplication issue the sender will add sequence numbers to"
"10-12","13:03","each packet okay that is very important how do we handle the duplications we add sequence"
"10-12","13:10","number to each packet so basically in this case when the"
"10-12","13:15","sender is rescinding a certain packet it will say oh I'm receiving packing fine"
"10-12","13:21","okay then receiver side we'll look at this packet and say oh"
"10-12","13:28","um if for example if I didn't receive packet file correctly then I will use"
"10-12","13:35","the new packet file if I have received 5 correctly then I'll just discard the"
"10-12","13:42","duplicate packet okay so that's what we do with uh with the duplication"
"10-12","13:50","okay and pay attention uh in this case we are"
"10-12","13:55","talking about a stop and read mode so basically the sender will send one"
"10-12","14:00","packet at a time then which for the receiver's response and then the sender"
"10-12","14:06","continue okay if the sender does not get any response from the receiver then the sense the sender cannot continue okay so"
"10-12","14:13","one pack at a time we are using a stop and wait wait let's now discuss the 2.1"
"10-12","14:21","okay I mean 2.1 is actually adding the sequence number okay adding the sequence"
"10-12","14:26","number 2.0 is we use a a c key and aak okay"
"10-12","14:33","so now second number is added into the packet um and the two two single numbers are"
"10-12","14:40","needed only two are needed actually 0 and 1 we are surface why because as we"
"10-12","14:47","said here we only need uh to send one packet at a time right so we only need"
"10-12","14:53","to uh denote this packet and this old packet and new packet so zero and one"
"10-12","14:59","are enough okay um and we also the center side also must"
"10-12","15:06","check if the received nak or ack is corrupted okay and the receiver side"
"10-12","15:12","then the receiver must have if the received packet is duplicated or not okay the receiver cannot know if its"
"10-12","15:21","last ack or any case is received okay at the center side"
"10-12","15:26","that means that receiver can send signals to the sender but it cannot know if that is or that is a received"
"10-12","15:33","correctly or not okay so it's like there is a curtain between the sender and the receiver side"
"10-12","15:40","now that is 2.1 okay let's review again 2.0 is we adding the and we use n a k"
"10-12","15:49","and ack okay to Signal the center"
"10-12","15:54","and 2.1 is we add six numbers to handle the duplications"
"10-12","16:00","okay now for 2.2 we want to design uh"
"10-12","16:06","nak free protocol so what does this mean"
"10-12","16:11","because we use ack both ack and nak to Signal the center right so that means if"
"10-12","16:20","we design the package the packet must have two fields one field is n a c k"
"10-12","16:26","another field is nak okay so we can we can see oh ack is one or is k0 and K is"
"10-12","16:33","one or NK 0. okay but we say the LA case"
"10-12","16:39","is kind of redundant we want to say how can we remove this one okay if we remove"
"10-12","16:44","this field we can basically save some space for for the data for example right so save some resources then that's why I"
"10-12","16:52","want to design a nak free protocol so that instead of naked what can the"
"10-12","16:58","receiver do to repeat the functionality of nak so this is a very interesting thing I"
"10-12","17:04","would say this design is is also very smart so let's now think about an example in this example you"
"10-12","17:11","let's see a okay you are sending a gift to be okay"
"10-12","17:19","to a friend b as New York okay and this is a"
"10-12","17:25","Christmas okay gift time and you shouldn't be as an apple"
"10-12","17:32","for the first time okay and B will say what"
"10-12","17:39","a c k Apple"
"10-12","17:44","right so then this means apple is good okay B"
"10-12","17:49","is very happy and then you send your friend uh Orange"
"10-12","17:57","okay and then your friend will send back he should send back ack Orange right but"
"10-12","18:05","if there is something wrong then previously what we will do is what we will see"
"10-12","18:12","m a k Orange right so something is wrong with orange"
"10-12","18:19","please send it again to me this is what we did originally but now if we want if"
"10-12","18:25","we want to remove an AK we want to remove this how can we replace it okay so what we"
"10-12","18:32","can do is is this your friend doesn't want to hurt you"
"10-12","18:38","so instead I was saying hey your orange is bad I don't like that"
"10-12","18:44","female constantly say oh I like the Apple so much okay"
"10-12","18:55","he doesn't want to hurt you so instead of saying the Orange is bad your friend"
"10-12","19:01","will just say oh the Apple is very good then you will begin to think oh what happens to my orange"
"10-12","19:07","okay I sent you orange but you didn't comment okay you just say oh something is very good about the last gift"
"10-12","19:14","right then this indicates something is wrong with my second gift with my orange"
"10-12","19:22","does this make sense okay so this is what we will do in in"
"10-12","19:28","the networking even now working instead of seeing naked instead of naked the current"
"10-12","19:35","package the receiver will just ack the last package received okay"
"10-12","19:45","okay it's similar to the orange Apple thing instead of naked only say the"
"10-12","19:50","Cardinal wine is not good we will just see the last one is good then the center will realize there is something wrong"
"10-12","19:57","with the current package that makes sense okay so that's what we will do okay so the"
"10-12","20:06","duplicate now even you will see oh the first time I have ack airport second time I have ack airport game this is uh"
"10-12","20:13","called a duplicate SDK"
"10-12","20:19","okay when we see a duplicate ack at the center side this will result in the same"
"10-12","20:25","action and and making okay we are basically retransmit to the current"
"10-12","20:31","package so it's like when you receive two ack"
"10-12","20:36","apples you will find some things wrong with your orange and then you will resend"
"10-12","20:43","another orange to a friend okay similar things in the networking if you"
"10-12","20:50","receive duplicate SDK for the last packet then you will need to resend or"
"10-12","20:55","re-transmit the current package and the next one RT 4.0 we will deal with the"
"10-12","21:01","channels which has errors and loss okay now it's not just errors"
"10-12","21:07","okay we may experience loss of packets then in this case what can we do okay so"
"10-12","21:14","now we can say in the end of this new assumption the underlying channel can also lose the packets like the data or"
"10-12","21:22","the AC Keys both of them okay and then um we may still use checksum to detect"
"10-12","21:29","errors we may still use sequence number to remove the duplications we may still"
"10-12","21:35","use AC keys but we may still do transmission they all help but not"
"10-12","21:40","enough why because those packets May simply get lost okay as I said it's like there is a curtain"
"10-12","21:47","between the sender and the receiver they cannot see each other they cannot communicate right so then uh when for"
"10-12","21:55","example when the sender sends something to the to the receiver the data gets lost at the receiver side the receiver"
"10-12","22:01","receives nothing right the receiver doesn't know what has happened okay so it will of course have has has"
"10-12","22:09","no reason no response to the sender and then at the center side the center receives no feedback from the receiver"
"10-12","22:16","right now what can the center do it cannot do a real transmission because it"
"10-12","22:21","it doesn't receive any duplicate sdks right so then what can we do in this"
"10-12","22:27","time in this case I will see the center"
"10-12","22:33","after sending out the packet it will wait for some time to wait for the response"
"10-12","22:40","okay if after a reasonable period of time the sender does not receive"
"10-12","22:46","anything then the sender will do a re-transmission okay so it's like if you send a gift to"
"10-12","22:53","your friend okay your gift should your friend should write a thank you letter to you okay if after 14 days you didn't"
"10-12","23:01","receive any thank you letter then you will reason the gift right so to make sure your friend"
"10-12","23:08","received the gift so this is what we do so basically the center will reach for a reasonable"
"10-12","23:17","amount of time here the keyword is reasonable okay and later we will discuss how we"
"10-12","23:24","get this reasonable time okay it's like when you send a gift to a friend you cannot say oh I listen again after one"
"10-12","23:31","hour doesn't make sense right it takes time for the gift to arrive at your friend it"
"10-12","23:36","takes time for a friend to write you the letter right so reasonable time is a is a very"
"10-12","23:42","important so the time the reasonable amount of time basically means the round trip time"
"10-12","23:47","we need to estimate hormone time is used to reach the"
"10-12","23:53","receiver and then how much time do we need for the receiver to send back the"
"10-12","23:58","feedback like a secure and K okay so it's like if you take if you really it"
"10-12","24:04","takes seven seven days from Sacramento to New York for the gift and then take"
"10-12","24:10","another seven days for the letter to arrive from your friend to you round"
"10-12","24:15","trip time into 14 days so that is a reasonable amount of time basically if the sender"
"10-12","24:22","um does not receive any ack during this time then the sender will re-transmit"
"10-12","24:27","okay if the package or the AC case just got delayed okay just got delayed not"
"10-12","24:35","lost okay for example the data is delayed it's not lost all the sdks are"
"10-12","24:41","just delayed are not lost then in this case the real transmission will be a duplicate okay but you don't need to"
"10-12","24:49","worry because the sequence numbers will handle this okay for example if let's see uh you"
"10-12","24:56","send your friend a gift and your friend replied A Letter by the letter you you"
"10-12","25:01","expect the 14 days to receive the letter but now um the letter arrived at the 15th day"
"10-12","25:10","okay but you already sent out another gift now in this case your friend will"
"10-12","25:15","receive two gifts from you right this is a duplicate but we don't need to worry about that because the sixth number will"
"10-12","25:22","handle the duplicate okay it's the same thing if the SDK just arrived late and"
"10-12","25:27","the sender has already sent out a packet okay has already retransmitted the"
"10-12","25:33","previous packet then the receiver may have duplications um in this case we just use secret"
"10-12","25:38","number to remove the duplication okay"
"10-12","25:43","um so then this means how do we wait for a reasonable time we just need a timer"
"10-12","25:50","okay we need a countdown timer okay so let's look at an example here"
"10-12","25:55","in this example we have a sender the sender is sending out packet zero here"
"10-12","26:01","we assume we have no Lots okay no loss everything is received the receiver will"
"10-12","26:06","receive package there and see ack package zero so we continue so the"
"10-12","26:14","packing one and AC key packet one then we send the package 0 again and ack"
"10-12","26:19","package 0. so here you can see we use only zero and a one as a single number because we said we it's already enough"
"10-12","26:25","okay but if we have a loss then what should we do take zero"
"10-12","26:32","ack 0 and then it sends out packet one Center package one and pack the one is"
"10-12","26:40","lost receiver has no response for packet one there you can see the sender will have a"
"10-12","26:48","timer when the timer times out it will resend packet one okay now the"
"10-12","26:54","receiver receives packing one and it will ack one and then centers and package zero the receiver ack0 so it"
"10-12","27:01","will continue okay so what if we have AC kilos"
"10-12","27:08","if we have AC key loss what will happen is Peck is zero acq zero as normal take it"
"10-12","27:15","one AC q1 but this time pay attention a"
"10-12","27:21","c k is lost that means at the center side the center"
"10-12","27:27","hears nothing from the receiver no feedback from the receiver then the"
"10-12","27:33","sender will say oh what should I do if nothing"
"10-12","27:39","if I hear nothing then I'll just rely on the timer if the timer times out then it"
"10-12","27:46","will reason the packet one then in this case at the receiver side you can see because the receiver has already"
"10-12","27:54","received packing one and it received package one again okay"
"10-12","28:00","and then the receiver will use the sequence numbers to deal with the"
"10-12","28:06","duplication so basically we'll say oh I received two packing one the second packing one will be discard discarded"
"10-12","28:13","okay so then it will continue as normal this is the AC key loss okay"
"10-12","28:20","and paper pay attention we set the timer must has a reasonable time"
"10-12","28:27","if the time is not reasonable then it will create some problems for example"
"10-12","28:33","pegas0 ack 0 Pack 1 and AC K1 AC K1 is"
"10-12","28:39","delayed so that's why packet one is firstly sent out again"
"10-12","28:46","and then we received Acky then in this case pay attention this ack one at the"
"10-12","28:52","center side the center will think this AC keyword is actually for"
"10-12","28:58","the new ecq one not the old AC camera right okay"
"10-12","29:04","so um and whatever happened next okay is"
"10-12","29:12","and the receiver side so don't get overwhelmed as a receiver side the"
"10-12","29:17","receiver will receive another packing one and then it will AC key one again"
"10-12","29:25","okay ack one again then you can see at the center side"
"10-12","29:32","it receives two AC one"
"10-12","29:38","in total received two AC key ones what does this mean"
"10-12","29:43","this means it is a duplicate right when we see we may have a duplicate AC key do"
"10-12","29:50","you remember what happened do you remember the apple or anything you didn't see anything about my orange"
"10-12","29:56","you kept seeing my Apple is good so that means something is wrong with my orange right you remember that"
"10-12","30:02","so here's the same thing sender has already sent out new packet"
"10-12","30:08","0. but from the center side it feels like oh you didn't say anything about my"
"10-12","30:14","new package zero but you kept seeing the package one is good that means packet"
"10-12","30:22","zero is not good so that's why the sender now is sending"
"10-12","30:28","out another packet zero again because send your thoughts there's something"
"10-12","30:35","wrong with the package zero so that's why it's reasoning again and because of this resending you can say now"
"10-12","30:43","again two ack zeros are received by the root sender right and you can"
"10-12","30:50","imagine the center will again send out the package one"
"10-12","30:56","repeatedly okay so then this will continue forever never stops okay so"
"10-12","31:03","that's why that's that's that means if you have a early timeout then you may have"
"10-12","31:11","duplicates a lot of duplicates okay it will continue forever okay so that's why"
"10-12","31:19","since uh setting the uh the timer for reasonable reasonable amount of time is"
"10-12","31:25","very important okay it's very important do not set up a premature time timer or"
"10-12","31:33","uh yes of course sometimes you cannot control the AC kit right if the AC keys are delayed then this is what you're"
"10-12","31:40","gonna say okay um so that is the"
"10-12","31:45","uh the 3.0 but the 14.0 the performance is is not"
"10-12","31:53","very good okay 3.0 is correct but the performance is not good why because every time you just send out one packet"
"10-12","32:00","and then you wait okay it's like that so every time you send"
"10-12","32:06","you take this much time do you remember the L over R thing okay so the L is the size"
"10-12","32:14","oh package L is the size of a packet"
"10-12","32:19","and R is the bandwidth okay or the packet transmission rate so now"
"10-12","32:26","the time we use the two send out the data is L over R the first"
"10-12","32:32","package right and after that you can see the data this is this is the time"
"10-12","32:39","okay at the center side and the receiver side this is the time so after the data is sent out the data"
"10-12","32:46","is is traveling to the receiver side okay and at the"
"10-12","32:53","center side A Center is reaching meeting for what for feedback okay is waiting"
"10-12","32:58","for feedback so all this time called rtt is wasted because the seller"
"10-12","33:05","is doing nothing during that time it's like every time you send out one layer"
"10-12","33:10","and then you wait for 14 days for your friends uh feedback"
"10-12","33:17","you send out one gift okay and then you send a second gift and you wait for"
"10-12","33:22","another seven 14 days okay so the efficiency is really bad if"
"10-12","33:28","you look at the utility utilization rate then it will be L over R which is this"
"10-12","33:34","time okay over divided by rtt plus L over this is"
"10-12","33:41","the total time okay the total time"
"10-12","33:47","then uh if if we follow the assumptions here we are following uh the bit packet"
"10-12","33:54","is the packet is has a 8 000 bits okay and we assume the proposition"
"10-12","34:00","propagation delay is 15 Ms and this bandwidth is uh uh one gigabs okay then"
"10-12","34:09","the transmission delay is Lor which is uh eighty eight thousand this over 10 to"
"10-12","34:17","9 this is one Gigan right 10 to 9 bits per second so that means the"
"10-12","34:22","transmission delay is 8 microseconds okay so then the utilization rate is"
"10-12","34:28","basically this this number okay it's basically L over r divided by rtt plus"
"10-12","34:35","Lor so this is uh eight microseconds and"
"10-12","34:40","then uh this is a uh this is the rtt the total rtt is 30."
"10-12","34:47","let's assume it's 30 microseconds okay so that's 30 plus 0.008 in total this will become"
"10-12","34:59","0.00027 okay that is the utilization rate it is very very very low okay so"
"10-12","35:06","how can we improve this we can improve this by sending multiple"
"10-12","35:15","packets at the same time okay we send multiple and we then we wait it's like"
"10-12","35:21","you send your friends 10 gifts and maybe wait for the response for those hand"
"10-12","35:26","gifts for the for the feedback right so that's how we improve the efficiency so"
"10-12","35:32","now let's summarize what we have learned today rtrt 1.0 is a completely reliable"
"10-12","35:38","Channel rdt 2.0 we will detect the arrow with checksum and we will send the"
"10-12","35:44","sender AC key and any case as feedback but in rdt 2.1 we want to avoid"
"10-12","35:52","duplicate packets okay so that's why we want to use the sequence numbers okay so"
"10-12","35:58","for rdt 2.2 we want to design a naked frame"
"10-12","36:04","protocol okay so what we do is instead of a nak the current package we ack the"
"10-12","36:14","last package received okay okay that is 2.2 remember the apple or an example"
"10-12","36:20","so for rdt 3.0 we will deal with packing loss how do we deal with that we will"
"10-12","36:27","introduce a countdown timer if the timer times out then we will do a"
"10-12","36:33","re-transmission for the artists we design"
"10-17","0:02","for the rdt that we designed they have uh very bad performance why because it"
"10-17","0:10","is using something called stop and wait which means every time I just send out"
"10-17","0:15","one package and then I'll just wait okay wait until I receive the feedback"
"10-17","0:22","then I send it again so apparently this is uh this is not very efficient"
"10-17","0:28","um then people began to think oh how about we send a multiple packets together and then receive for the AC"
"10-17","0:33","keys so that for those kind of protocols we call them as pipeline protocol okay there are two types of pipeline"
"10-17","0:41","protocols go back in and select to repeat so then first thing let's take an"
"10-17","0:47","overview of these two protocols what are their difference for go back-end protocol the sender can"
"10-17","0:54","have up to n and a secret package in the pipeline"
"10-17","0:59","okay so that means we can send up to n packets out together then when the"
"10-17","1:06","receiver receives the package the receiver has a problem to to resolve how"
"10-17","1:11","should we do the ack okay if we if I receive for example 10"
"10-17","1:16","packets how should I execute them should I execute them individually"
"10-17","1:23","okay uh for go back and the method taken by the receiver is to send a cumulative ack"
"10-17","1:32","what does this mean this means if we have packet 1 to 10 for example they are"
"10-17","1:37","all received correctly then the receiver will only Act 10. AC content already"
"10-17","1:44","means all the pack is up to 10 are received correctly okay but pay attention if there is a gap"
"10-17","1:52","between them we do not execate the package so for example now"
"10-17","1:58","if we have packet one to five okay and six is missing then we have"
"10-17","2:06","seven eight nine and ten these 10 packets okay this is the center"
"10-17","2:14","at the receiver side the receiver will ack 1"
"10-17","2:20","might received one into execute one I'm going to receive two AC key 2 okay"
"10-17","2:26","executive 3 is equal four AC K5 6 is missing"
"10-17","2:31","okay six is the missing so nothing is sent back then when seven comes in"
"10-17","2:38","when someone comes in the receiver will not ack 7 why because this is cumulative"
"10-17","2:46","this SDK is a cumulative if we ac K7 that means everything up to 7 is good is"
"10-17","2:52","received correctly but that's not correct right that's not wrong and sorry that's not correct that's uh that's"
"10-17","2:58","wrong because 6 is missing right so that's why instead of sending backs acq7"
"10-17","3:06","we will still Escape 5. so for eight we will still execute five nine still a65 term is still execified"
"10-17","3:13","so we keep repeating ack 5 so that's the center and then we all"
"10-17","3:19","know oh something is wrong with six okay then the central wheel has a timer we'll"
"10-17","3:27","have a timer for the oldest NAC kit package okay that means for six in this case"
"10-17","3:34","it's six so when the timer expires the sender will re-transmit"
"10-17","3:42","all and executed packets okay we transmit all and execute packets"
"10-17","3:51","so this is the go back in selective repeat is different for Selective repeats again we can still"
"10-17","3:59","have up to n and executive packs in the pipeline let's assume we have again one"
"10-17","4:05","two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay"
"10-17","4:13","and the sender let's assume 6 is missing again okay the center will send individual ack"
"10-17","4:21","for each packet okay so that means if you are execute one two"
"10-17","4:28","three four five and seven eight nine ten okay so the"
"10-17","4:39","timer sorry the sender maintain maintains a timer for each NAC kit"
"10-17","4:45","packet that means the center will maintain a timer for package six when"
"10-17","4:52","the time expires it will retransmit only that and ack package that means only six"
"10-17","4:58","is root transmitted okay nothing else so this is the difference between go"
"10-17","5:04","back and and select or repeat so then uh what I'll do next is um I'm"
"10-17","5:12","going to use an animation to to to help you get a better understanding"
"10-17","5:17","so now let's see this is the go back-end protocol if you uh Google search"
"10-17","5:24","computer networking and top-down approach that's the title of our textbook and you also add student"
"10-17","5:31","resources then uh you can find this page okay on this page you can click on"
"10-17","5:36","interactive animations uh there are some very interesting animations here you can look into that"
"10-17","5:44","um and for our class today we will look at this go back and protocol okay"
"10-17","5:50","so keep what I said in mind go back and is a cumulative is using a cumulative"
"10-17","5:59","ack okay and think about the gaps if there is gaps it will"
"10-17","6:05","not act the um the package after the Gap okay so let's"
"10-17","6:12","see we send let me firstly explain what these are okay so this part"
"10-17","6:19","this line above is the center okay and this from 0 to 19 these are the"
"10-17","6:27","packets we that are uh waiting to be sent out then uh this line below is the receiver"
"10-17","6:36","okay again these packets are just these are not packages are just like let's say"
"10-17","6:41","they are uh you can view them as a holders okay um these are just used to hold those"
"10-17","6:49","packets okay so now let's assume the uh sender has a"
"10-17","6:56","window size on five that means each time animals the five packets can"
"10-17","7:04","be sent out okay so the sending when the limb is the standard to a maximum of"
"10-17","7:10","five outstanding and executed packets and you can see um now I send out to five if I want to"
"10-17","7:18","resume I cannot send a new because of the window sites when the packets are received by the receiver in the package"
"10-17","7:25","mail acknowledgment those packets right so for example when zero is received you"
"10-17","7:31","can see it will execute zero ack 1 hq2 is equal to three and four"
"10-17","7:37","and those are all the acks okay those are all the AC Keys AC keys are also"
"10-17","7:43","similar to like a regular packets okay and then when zero is received"
"10-17","7:50","when zero nck 0 is received this window will slide to the right"
"10-17","7:57","okay so that means oh package 0 is received fine it's received okay then"
"10-17","8:05","the center will see now you can send one more packet okay because the window size is the five"
"10-17","8:10","we can allow at most five and execated data packets"
"10-17","8:15","so you can see it is uh moving to the right element one is received it's moving right two three"
"10-17","8:22","four it's like that okay and I can of course listen some new packets"
"10-17","8:30","okay so for the first situation for the first situation now you realize"
"10-17","8:37","um oh everything is fine we have no loss no errors right"
"10-17","8:43","in the second situation okay in the second scenario let's discuss what if the data is lost what if a packet loss"
"10-17","8:50","so let's see example let's kill this package package seven got lost during"
"10-17","8:57","this process so when 5 is received can tell me what"
"10-17","9:02","is AC kit so we will do ack 5. right"
"10-17","9:09","so when six is received we will do a c k six"
"10-17","9:15","okay you can see 5 6r AC kit now let me ask you a question"
"10-17","9:20","what if 8 is received what will happen"
"10-17","9:26","what will be the AC key number so in this case with ack 6 why because"
"10-17","9:34","there is a gap between 6 and 8. okay that means something is wrong after six"
"10-17","9:42","that's why you can see we are still ack 6 AC k6"
"10-17","9:48","okay and you can see one five and ack five and six are received the window is"
"10-17","9:53","sliding to the right but 1 6 8 6 are received again"
"10-17","9:59","will the windows slide to the right should we Slide the window to the right no because 7 is not received right so"
"10-17","10:08","that's why you can see even n66 is received it doesn't help okay and"
"10-17","10:14","of course now you have two more positions you can send out two more okay"
"10-17","10:19","but what will happen next what will happen next is still in statistics right"
"10-17","10:26","so now the time the sender has a timer okay when the timer is for the oldest"
"10-17","10:34","NAC package which is seven so when the time expires the package all the packets"
"10-17","10:40","that are unexecated will be sent out together okay now you can see the time I didn't"
"10-17","10:46","do anything okay so the timer times out then 7 to 11 are all sent out and then"
"10-17","10:53","they are all easy kids this is the case when the data is lost"
"10-17","11:02","the next case we are going to discuss is what if other"
"10-17","11:07","what if the ack is lost"
"10-17","11:13","so now I send out this five package again and we have those AC keys"
"10-17","11:21","okay now I want to maybe delete 14 again"
"10-17","11:28","okay pay attention this time is the ack"
"10-17","11:34","getting lost okay acq is lost then let's guess what will happen when 12 is when"
"10-17","11:42","ack 12 is received at the center side should we Slide the window to the right"
"10-17","11:49","yes yeah when we receive 12"
"10-17","11:54","we can slide to the right how about 13. should we slide them into the right"
"10-17","12:07","yes okay we should also slide to the right so then for 14 we have no AC key"
"10-17","12:14","how about 15. for 15 should we Slide the window to the"
"10-17","12:19","right"
"10-17","12:24","this is a very interesting question should we Slide the window to the right"
"10-17","12:30","so now let's step back to think about the meaning of ack"
"10-17","12:36","what are the exact 15 mean keep in mind this is cumulative"
"10-17","12:42","nck 15 means all the packets up to 15 are received"
"10-17","12:49","okay pay attention to this sentence all the"
"10-17","12:55","packets up to 15 are received okay"
"10-17","13:03","so then does this mean 14 is okay yes or no"
"10-17","13:11","ack 15. also pay attention 15 also implies"
"10-17","13:17","14 is fine right okay then with this in mind with this in"
"10-17","13:25","mind should we Slide the window to the right"
"10-17","13:30","so in this case we should slide them into the right why because as I said again"
"10-17","13:35","ack and go back and ack's Community when we"
"10-17","13:41","execute a number that basically means all the packets up to that number are received fine then in this case although"
"10-17","13:48","within the ack 14 is fine because basically 15 already implies ack 14."
"10-17","13:55","okay so then then you can see it is actually select to the right"
"10-17","14:01","okay so now of course we can send some more packets out and then wait for them"
"10-17","14:06","to be execated let's do it again and so you can then think about the different scenarios okay"
"10-17","14:13","for the first scenario for the first scenario we send all all"
"10-17","14:19","of them out okay then there are OAC kits nothing happened no errors no loss pay special"
"10-17","14:28","attention to this protocol because go back and selective repeat may appear on the final exam okay"
"10-17","14:35","and then let's just resume I'm sending some some more out"
"10-17","14:43","and if we have some data loss okay I can"
"10-17","14:48","use this case I can kill Maybe let's see k06 okay and you can see what"
"10-17","14:56","will happen is ack 5 5 8 6 5 again"
"10-17","15:04","okay and it's not sliding to the right because 6 is not AC key"
"10-17","15:11","okay and then when the timer times out"
"10-17","15:16","all the NAC kit package will be recent"
"10-17","15:25","we are waiting for the timer to time out okay you can see six seven eight nine they are all recent I can send more"
"10-17","15:33","okay they are all ack"
"10-17","15:41","and some send some more okay and if the ack is lost"
"10-17","15:50","okay if the AC key is lost then"
"10-17","15:57","you think about this what will happen next the window will slide to the right"
"10-17","16:05","window will slide to the right and then 14 is received the window will"
"10-17","16:10","also slide to the right because ack 14 implies ack 13."
"10-17","16:18","okay and then we can continue so this is the go back and protocol"
"10-17","16:24","uh and I'll I'll continue to talk about the selective repeat"
"10-17","16:31","okay if you recall what we have discussed about selector repeat in selective repeat we will do the"
"10-17","16:38","individual executes okay there's no cumulative AC keys so individual sdks"
"10-17","16:43","and then the timer is kept for each and executed packet it's not for the oldest"
"10-17","16:50","and executive package okay it's a selective repeat is for each the timer is for each and executed packet so then"
"10-17","16:58","uh when the timer times out um the sender will resend only that"
"10-17","17:06","execute packet okay so let's see there's a new"
"10-17","17:14","and if nothing happens then it's just a similar ads uh the go back in"
"10-17","17:23","okay but if for example if we lose some packet let's see"
"10-17","17:29","six and eight are killed and whatever happened is you can see"
"10-17","17:35","ack 5 ack 7 and ack 9. do we do AC K5"
"10-17","17:40","here no we do not okay do we do AC K7 5 here no we do not so I although there"
"10-17","17:47","are gaps but but as you can see we only ack"
"10-17","17:53","um those ones that are received correctly okay and interestingly as you can see"
"10-17","17:58","here uh when we receive five okay we just mark this as received because there"
"10-17","18:05","is no gap between five and uh the packs before okay for this one we have we"
"10-17","18:12","haven't received six at the receiver side so nothing is powerful there but we received seven so at the receiver side"
"10-17","18:18","the sum is buffered okay seven is buffered similarly to nine nine is buffered at the receiver side okay and"
"10-17","18:26","now this the receiver is waiting for six and eight okay and only five seven nine"
"10-17","18:31","they are AC kit as you can see then the window will slide to the right"
"10-17","18:37","okay so here the window will not slide to the right because there is a gap for"
"10-17","18:43","six okay six is not executed yet so then as we said the timer is for each"
"10-17","18:51","individual and AC kit package so the timer will be for six and also eight"
"10-17","18:57","okay so you can see only six and eight are recent okay nothing else only six and eight"
"10-17","19:03","then with your ack 6 and 8 okay then they are marked as received because there is no gap between this package"
"10-17","19:11","okay so this receiver side also has a receiving window then it is sliding to"
"10-17","19:16","the right okay so then the their AC kit in the center window will also slide to"
"10-17","19:22","the right okay this is what will happen and another case we want to test is what"
"10-17","19:29","we what will happen if acks are if acks are killed let's see let's see we kill"
"10-17","19:36","11 whatever happened so what is lost"
"10-17","19:42","um although at the receiver side we all we know they are all received correctly right but at the center side when 10"
"10-17","19:49","arrives we know the window will slide to the right okay when ack 12 arrives the"
"10-17","19:54","window will not select slide to the right this is different from go back and forth go back and we know act 12 implies"
"10-17","20:02","basically 11 so the window will slide to the right but here for Selective repeat we know this is for each case for each"
"10-17","20:09","individual packet so basically 12 only implies ack 12. uh that doesn't that has"
"10-17","20:18","no relationship with 11 what happened to 11. so in this case the window will not"
"10-17","20:23","slide to the right okay similar for 13 14 okay this is what will happen"
"10-17","20:30","and you can see slide no slide no slide no slide okay and then you may Wonder oh"
"10-17","20:35","what will happen next what will happen next is the timer there is a timer for"
"10-17","20:40","11. because this is an executed when the timer times out"
"10-17","20:45","this 11 package will be resent okay you can see it is reset and you may"
"10-17","20:53","ask oh what if uh oh the 11 is recent but actually 11 is always already"
"10-17","20:58","already received correctly at the receiver side now the receiver will have a duplicate packets right have two"
"10-17","21:05","elements what will happen next this is very easy you don't need to worry because"
"10-17","21:10","we know these packets are all um they all have their own sequence numbers right so the receiver side can"
"10-17","21:17","directly discard this new element because it will say oh I have received this package I don't need it anymore"
"10-17","21:23","okay so this will be discarded"
"10-17","21:29","okay although it's this is discarded but it will still send back ack to let the"
"10-17","21:35","sender know 11 is fine it's received correctly okay then this time this"
"10-17","21:41","window can slide to the right okay so this is the entire process for Selective"
"10-17","21:46","repeat and uh I'll just stop sharing here"
"10-17","21:52","so make sure you really understand this part"
"10-17","21:57","um because this will appear on the test now let's look at uh we have explained"
"10-17","22:03","how it works right um so in the slides uh let me just quickly go over this slide so when you"
"10-17","22:10","review the slides you understand what is uh shown on that on those okay so"
"10-17","22:15","basically as you can see for these are all the packets that we want to send out"
"10-17","22:23","okay and these ones are not usable uh the the green ones are already execated"
"10-17","22:29","this is at the center side okay uh the yellow ones are sent but not yet"
"10-17","22:35","execated okay um these ones are the usable space that"
"10-17","22:40","means uh we can still send out to those ones okay and the window size is and this is basically the same as we have"
"10-17","22:47","discussed in the animation um so we know the timer is for the"
"10-17","22:54","oldest in-flight package okay when the timer times out then we will retransmit"
"10-17","22:59","all the packets okay all the packets that are not sick"
"10-17","23:04","so here is a an example okay in this example as you can see we have the uh"
"10-17","23:11","sender window and equals to four that means and most we can send out to four okay and then for the uh then for the"
"10-17","23:20","very beginning we can see we were sent out at the center side we are sent out 0 1 2 3. okay and you can see here the"
"10-17","23:28","packet two gets lost okay at the receiver side the receiver will just AC key ack 0 acq one and two is not"
"10-17","23:37","received so nothing nothing is down here okay and then once third arrives when"
"10-17","23:44","packet 3 arrives with a steel sent out packet uh ack 1"
"10-17","23:49","because there is a gap between 1 and 3. okay so as you can see actually packet"
"10-17","23:57","three is discarded it's not buffered in slightly repeat we know this is this"
"10-17","24:02","will be buffered but in go back and this will be discarded okay"
"10-17","24:08","and then um all these AC keys are sent out okay"
"10-17","24:13","um as at the center side as you can see when it received ACP zero the window will slide to the right and now we can"
"10-17","24:20","send out the four okay when it received ack one the manual slide to the right"
"10-17","24:26","and now we can send out packet five okay so then one package four and five are"
"10-17","24:33","received again they will be discarded why because still at the receiver side"
"10-17","24:39","the receiver didn't receive package two okay so you can say they will still ack"
"10-17","24:45","1 means which means there is something happening to two Okay and finally the"
"10-17","24:52","timer times out okay the timer for package two times out because two is not execated and then all"
"10-17","25:00","the pack is up to five are recent okay two three four five are recent so this"
"10-17","25:05","is the entire process uh it actually shows the same thing as in animation but"
"10-17","25:11","uh we just put it uh on a static picture okay on static picture"
"10-17","25:18","and then for a selective repeats as we said receiver individually AC key uh all"
"10-17","25:24","the correctly received packets and those packets will be buffered at the receiver side and the center side the center will"
"10-17","25:31","keep a timer for every packet individual package when timer times out then the"
"10-17","25:38","sender will resend only those and executed packets okay so so this card is"
"10-17","25:44","the same the center part is the same as the receiver part you can see it has a receiver and the window so then you can"
"10-17","25:51","see uh these are the expected but not yet received okay and these ones are"
"10-17","25:58","out of order packets that means they are received they are buffered"
"10-17","26:03","okay and then this is the acceptable uh"
"10-17","26:08","positions okay that means for these ones we are still except expecting packets new packs coming okay"
"10-17","26:17","so basically um here we can look at an example I think we don't need to talk about this"
"10-17","26:24","um part yeah we can directly look at this example in this example we have"
"10-17","26:31","um package zero one two three sent out again package two is lost okay and you"
"10-17","26:37","can see one pack zero is received with an SDK 0 then we've seen ick one and"
"10-17","26:44","when we receive packet third we know 2 is not received yet so in this case we will just buffer"
"10-17","26:52","the package through and send back executor okay and similarly when ack 0"
"10-17","26:59","is received then the window will slide to the right now we send out packet four similarly for AC key one then we Slide"
"10-17","27:07","the window to the right then send out packet five okay and now we received AC"
"10-17","27:13","key through okay we receive ack3 we cannot slide to"
"10-17","27:18","the right because you can see this is a third and two is not received yet"
"10-17","27:25","okay ac2 not received so here we cannot Slide the window to"
"10-17","27:32","the right okay that's why you can see we we only we need to wait for the timer"
"10-17","27:38","okay the timer expires then packet two is recent only package with reason we do"
"10-17","27:45","not resend two three four five okay and then at the receiver side the"
"10-17","27:51","receiver has already buffered packet four packet 5 package three okay and now"
"10-17","27:58","two is received so then it will basically combine two three four five and then deliver them to the upper side"
"10-17","28:04","to the upper application layer okay so uh at the same time the sender the"
"10-17","28:11","receiver will also send back AC key to tell the sender hey two is now fine okay"
"10-17","28:17","so this is the entire process um again so this may appear on the test"
"10-17","28:26","and this may appear on the test so in the test that I may describe this so for"
"10-17","28:31","example I give you a bunch of packets I say oh um the center is sending uh one two"
"10-17","28:38","three four and what happens to to some packets okay oh what happened to some AC Keys then what will"
"10-17","28:45","be the package that what will this what will what package will the center send next"
"10-17","28:51","okay or what what AC keys without the receiver sending next to those kind of things so you should be uh well familiar"
"10-17","28:59","with vest and you should really understand the principles behind so you can answer them correctly"
"10-17","29:05","okay for selecting repeat there is a very interesting thing okay we call this as"
"10-17","29:12","the selective dilemma okay so what what is what does this mean basically"
"10-17","29:18","um when you use select to repeat you have to be very careful about the"
"10-17","29:24","relationship between a window size and sequence number that means if you have a"
"10-17","29:30","window size like third then your secret number should be as big as 7. okay you"
"10-17","29:36","should have zero one two three four until seven to be as the second number if you choose a secret uh the second"
"10-17","29:44","number to be only 0 1 2 3 then you may run into a problem okay so let's let's"
"10-17","29:50","together look at the problem um so in the first case"
"10-17","29:56","in this case okay this case is defined it has no problem you can see we are sending out"
"10-17","30:02","uh the window size is three right so we are sending out to zero one two and 012 are received correctly"
"10-17","30:11","then you can see this one will will is basically it will sorry it's the AC key"
"10-17","30:19","zero Okay so when ack 0 is received"
"10-17","30:26","the window is slide to the right with us an out packet through okay"
"10-17","30:32","um and unfortunately package 3 is lost this time okay it is lost"
"10-17","30:40","um but anyway when packing when when uh AC went this one so when this is uh this"
"10-17","30:47","week this is ack 0 is this is your acq one right so when AC keyword is received"
"10-17","30:53","we will slide the window to the right again so this time we send out a package zero Okay so pay attention this zero is"
"10-17","31:02","the new pack is here"
"10-17","31:07","okay which means it's this one is not the the one before it's not the old"
"10-17","31:13","packager it's the new package zero okay and this is a this has no problem"
"10-17","31:19","but for the next case if you look at the next case okay in this case we received package uh"
"10-17","31:26","we sent out zero one two okay then we were ack 0 AC K1 AC K2 okay"
"10-17","31:34","unfortunately these AC keys are all lost"
"10-17","31:40","okay then in this case we know there is a timer for zero one two right so"
"10-17","31:46","because those AC keys are all lost so the timer will finally expires we'll"
"10-17","31:51","find an inspired then in this case the timer will retransmit 0 1 and 2."
"10-17","31:58","okay it will really transmit zero and amount to resend one zero one and two so"
"10-17","32:04","in this case this pack is zero as is actually the old zero"
"10-17","32:15","this pack is zero is actually this one it's the old zero it's not the new zero"
"10-17","32:21","no okay it's not the new zero it's actually o zero because it's actually rescinding"
"10-17","32:28","but if you put up for these two cases these two scenarios"
"10-17","32:33","if you put a curtain between the sender and the receiver"
"10-17","32:39","as this the receiver side okay and the receiver side the receiver"
"10-17","32:44","is AC key one a zero sck one ack 2 and"
"10-17","32:49","then it receives a package zero right so it will think this package zero"
"10-17","32:57","is a new zero in the second case it's also doing ack 0"
"10-17","33:05","acq1 acq2 and then it receives a pack zero"
"10-17","33:12","okay and in this case it will also view this package 0 as a new zero"
"10-17","33:20","but it is actually the old zero okay this this is this is a is a"
"10-17","33:30","viewed as"
"10-17","33:36","new but it is uh actually"
"10-17","33:45","out zero okay it's viewed as new pack zero but"
"10-17","33:51","it's actually the old package zero so that is the problem because at the receiver side the"
"10-17","33:58","receiver does not see any difference between these two cases nothing different"
"10-17","34:04","okay but actually we know at the center side it's different the center in the"
"10-17","34:09","first case of the center is sending a new package zero in the second case the packet 0 is actually the old package"
"10-17","34:15","zero it's just a resending okay so that is what we call as dilemma"
"10-17","34:21","then in this case we we know um there is something between the sixth"
"10-17","34:27","number and the window size okay so if the window size is K"
"10-17","34:35","foreign"
"10-17","35:09","number should be at least 0 to 2 2 K minus one okay that means if K is a"
"10-17","35:17","third then this number will be seven two two three minus one seven so the second number should be zero one two three two"
"10-17","35:23","seven at least okay so in order to award certain kind of dilemma okay so that's"
"10-17","35:31","something you should keep in mind uh so that's all about the reliability"
"10-17","35:37","transfer and about about the go back and select to repeat"
"10-19","0:02","we will continue to discuss the real protocol that we are using in reality"
"10-19","0:09","okay the real reliable protocol we are using in reality which is TCP okay"
"10-19","0:15","e3.4 we just learned the principle uh principles how would we design those"
"10-19","0:21","protocols by in 3.5 we are going to discuss um"
"10-19","0:27","the actual protocol we are using in reality okay"
"10-19","0:33","so for TCP uh we know this is uh"
"10-19","0:39","um a reliable protocol and it will do reliable delivery and the byte stream"
"10-19","0:46","will be in order okay we only have one sender and one receiver"
"10-19","0:52","okay um and we know we are we will use pipeline because we want to improve the"
"10-19","0:59","performance okay the efficiency um but we also do the congression"
"10-19","1:06","control and flow control congestion control and flow control are different I have been talking about this for"
"10-19","1:12","multiple times so flow control is not to overwhelm the receiver congestion"
"10-19","1:18","control is not to overwhelm the public network okay so please remember this"
"10-19","1:23","sentence and I will ask you in the text what is the difference between fallow control and congestion control okay"
"10-19","1:30","and the TCP is also full duplex the data is the four duplex okay that means um"
"10-19","1:37","the data May travel bi-directionally okay from Center to receiver to from receiver to the sender okay and there is"
"10-19","1:45","also something called MSS MSS means maximum segment size"
"10-19","1:52","okay that means the maximum size for each segment reversion segment is like"
"10-19","1:59","the basic units for TCP okay or base unit in the transport layer okay and in"
"10-19","2:07","one segment in one segment we may send out multiple bytes"
"10-19","2:12","keep this in mind one segment may contain multiple bytes okay or a lot of"
"10-19","2:18","bytes um and it's also connection oriented which means uh before we do the data"
"10-19","2:25","exchange we will firstly need to do the handshaking which means we say hi hi okay to confirm we are establishing a"
"10-19","2:32","connection between the sender and the receiver okay uh and it's also uh as I said it will"
"10-19","2:39","also do the flow control okay I have already mentioned this so let's look at the second structure"
"10-19","2:46","this is the TCP segment structure do you remember"
"10-19","3:10","do you remember I have mentioned this again again okay we have five layers application layer transport layer etc"
"10-19","3:17","etc and I'll add the application layer we know the thing we we send out is"
"10-19","3:22","called message right and when message comes down to the transport layer usually we will break this into smaller"
"10-19","3:30","pieces okay and then we add header onto that message okay"
"10-19","3:36","foreign"
"10-19","3:45","so this is the transporter layer header and then inside is the message okay it"
"10-19","3:52","may be the entire message or just a piece of message okay and then you can"
"10-19","3:57","see um what we are talking here"
"10-19","4:04","is actually this entire thing this is called a segment"
"10-19","4:11","this is a TCP segment okay so what is shown here"
"10-19","4:16","is actually this one I'm I'm actually enlarging this entire"
"10-19","4:22","segment and show you the structure for this element okay so this thing"
"10-19","4:34","is the transporter layer header so what what I have shown here"
"10-19","4:43","is the transporter layer header okay"
"10-19","4:48","this part is actually the M part it's the message part okay and let's see what is included in a"
"10-19","4:56","transport layer header in the transport layer header we have Source port number definition phone"
"10-19","5:03","number okay and then we also have the sequence"
"10-19","5:09","number okay um after the sequence number the secret"
"10-19","5:15","number is basically uh showing like it's like um"
"10-19","5:20","because we know this packet this segment is going to is going to send some data"
"10-19","5:26","right so the data are in a byte stream okay by to zero byte one by two by three"
"10-19","5:31","by the four it's like that okay so then if this data if this piece of data"
"10-19","5:37","contains for example byte 8 to byte 11 okay then the sequence number here we"
"10-19","5:43","are basically showing you shows you the very first byte number so if this is byte 8 2 byte 11 the sixth number will"
"10-19","5:50","be eight okay and then this is the acknowledgment number"
"10-19","5:56","okay uh which means uh again if we are ack for example if we are ack uh 11 then"
"10-19","6:04","this acknowledgment number will be 11. okay so then after that we will say uh a"
"10-19","6:12","field called header length this is the length of the header okay and then there are also some bits u a p r s f okay"
"10-19","6:20","these beads are used for establishing the connection finishing the connection"
"10-19","6:27","uh for uh um some urgent data okay U is generally"
"10-19","6:33","not used is for Urgent data and a is for a c k a number of valid or not so what does"
"10-19","6:41","this mean this means if a for example equal to 1 we can say oh this is a AC key packet"
"10-19","6:48","okay and we are acknowledge the acknowledgment number in this field is"
"10-19","6:55","valid okay if a c k equals to zero if this a equal to zero okay that means oh this is"
"10-19","7:03","not for ack okay so the number we have in the AC key acknowledgment number"
"10-19","7:09","maybe uh invalid okay you don't need to pay attention to that because this is"
"10-19","7:14","not ack okay select that and then P is for pushing data now it's uh generally"
"10-19","7:21","not used R is for this R's S and F are for"
"10-19","7:26","uh set up a connection okay for synchronize uh or for finishing a"
"10-19","7:33","connection and later we are going to use that okay then this receive window this receive"
"10-19","7:40","window is for flow control and we are going to learn about this later okay"
"10-19","7:46","then after that we have checked some check sum we know this is a four checking errors okay and then this is a"
"10-19","7:55","disapp pointer okay urgently important so um after that we will have options okay the"
"10-19","8:03","options is optional uh it has a variable lens"
"10-19","8:08","okay most of the time it's not used but sometimes it's a"
"10-19","8:14","maybe used okay after that then this part as I said is the application layer"
"10-19","8:20","data which means it is the message part okay it can be an entire message or a"
"10-19","8:27","piece of message if the message is big okay now let's look at the header itself for the header each row is 32 bits"
"10-19","8:36","okay each row is 32-bit which means"
"10-19","8:42","four bytes okay how many rows do we have for the header we have one two three four five"
"10-19","8:52","five rows which means 20 bytes right four bytes each row four"
"10-19","9:01","times five equal to 20 so 20 bytes together okay and there is also options"
"10-19","9:07","options we may or may not have it so then based on this we know the TCP"
"10-19","9:12","header is at least"
"10-19","9:19","20 bytes okay TCP header it's at least 20 bytes"
"10-19","9:25","so it's actually very long okay later when we learn about UDP in the University UDP header is much shorter than this"
"10-19","9:32","okay and now if you if you think about what"
"10-19","9:37","we have learned before again we said the transport layer is dealing with processes"
"10-19","9:44","now you can think about this why do we say that because the transport layer has"
"10-19","9:50","The Source support number and the destination Point number and we know those port numbers are for the processes"
"10-19","9:57","right we associate one process with a port number okay so it's like that"
"10-19","10:05","um so as I said the secret number so you may"
"10-19","10:11","ask what is inside the second number I just explained right but let's look at this picture then you will have a better"
"10-19","10:16","understanding okay so in this is like this is like a byte stream"
"10-19","10:22","okay this is a byte stream and then um"
"10-19","10:27","if if this segment contains as again it contains let's say"
"10-19","10:33","byte 8 to 11 okay so then the second number will be eight"
"10-19","10:39","okay if we are executing this entire segment okay and then we know this is a"
"10-19","10:47","community basically so we may exactly 11 okay then"
"10-19","10:52","the acknowledgment number will be the 11 okay so as you can see this will be the"
"10-19","11:00","sequence number okay and uh this will be the AC key"
"10-19","11:06","number okay so what we are sick and pay attention when we are using ack we are"
"10-19","11:13","also uh setting this a bit into zero to indicate this is this AC key number is"
"10-19","11:21","valid okay and now let's look at our example here"
"10-19","11:27","so before we learned before go backhand for example it's using Community"
"10-19","11:33","basically and we know if for example we have one two three four five they are"
"10-19","11:39","all received then we can need we can ack fine right so that's what we learned"
"10-19","11:45","and TCP if TCP is also using cumulative ack"
"10-19","11:51","okay but very interestingly TCP does not do act 5"
"10-19","11:57","it will do a66 what does this mean this means"
"10-19","12:03","everything up to six up to five is correct and I'm expecting six"
"10-19","12:11","okay so instead of basically in the previous month I I just tell the sender what I'm expecting"
"10-19","12:17","okay that's how we do ack in TCP it's similar to go back and but a little bit"
"10-19","12:23","different just a little bit different okay so you can see"
"10-19","12:29","see this okay this is what what explained here so when we do the ack"
"10-19","12:35","with the ack the sequence number our next byte respected from the other side"
"10-19","12:42","okay so let's look at this example and then you will understand that okay"
"10-19","12:47","in this example host a and host B are sending data to each other okay and the"
"10-19","12:54","host a the user is typing in a letter say okay and this letter C we know this is a"
"10-19","13:02","in a byte stream okay byte history"
"10-19","13:09","okay and then um at the sequence number 42"
"10-19","13:18","okay it is actually sending a letter c okay and then you can see what what a is"
"10-19","13:26","saying is uh I am sending say okay and the second number is 42."
"10-19","13:31","the data is say and the ack number is 79 you mean you may ask how do we get 79 I"
"10-19","13:39","mean the at the very beginning A and B they are communicating they will actually negotiate the sequence number"
"10-19","13:46","and a second number so this is sequence number and AC key number they are telling each other okay they'll tell"
"10-19","13:52","each other what number would be so now host a will directly say I'm inspecting"
"10-19","13:59","your um uh your by 79 okay I'm sending you my"
"10-19","14:06","buy to 42 but I am expecting your bite 79 what does this mean because this is"
"10-19","14:11","the data is is a it's bi-directional so B also has a byte stream"
"10-19","14:23","okay and then"
"10-19","14:30","okay this is B's side at b side and B is probably also it's just also echoing"
"10-19","14:38","what is sent by the a okay so if a centimeter uh C let her say"
"10-19","14:43","then and B will also send back a letter C so then this is also literacy"
"10-19","14:49","okay of course you can do something else right if you send an essay I'm missing you uh e or F or whatever it doesn't"
"10-19","14:56","really matter okay so let's assume B is just acting what is set by a then this C"
"10-19","15:02","is actually at b side is actually at byte 79."
"10-19","15:07","okay so the a is telling B hey I'm sending you my C and I'm also expecting"
"10-19","15:14","you to um send me your byte 79 okay so then B"
"10-19","15:20","receives a c b will send back 79 bytes"
"10-19","15:25","okay byte 79 so B will say okay you are"
"10-19","15:30","expecting 79 so I'm sending you back 79."
"10-19","15:36","579 that's why the secret number is 79 and the data I'm sending back is"
"10-19","15:42","actually C I'm echoing so that's why I say of course you can send it letter e or letter whatever okay"
"10-19","15:49","and I'm telling you I'm expecting 40 through"
"10-19","15:56","why because you have already sent me 42. so the next bite I know you are going to"
"10-19","16:04","have 43 so I'm this this is the way I'm telling you I have received 42 correctly"
"10-19","16:10","so I'm expecting 43. so B is expecting 43 and then when a receives"
"10-19","16:19","this entire package a will say okay so you are expecting 43 then I'm sending"
"10-19","16:26","you back 43. my secret number this time is 43 and I'm a 1680 that means I have"
"10-19","16:33","received your last packet correctly I'm now expecting the next byte which is a"
"10-19","16:40","580. okay so this is the entire process for"
"10-19","16:47","um for the communication between them okay uh so of course the data distance"
"10-19","16:53","between each other may be different so for example as the whole side I may send back computer"
"10-19","16:59","foreign"
"10-19","17:05","okay so this may be 44 45"
"10-19","17:12","46 47 48 49 it's like that okay and so B may"
"10-19","17:20","be sending back something different it may be sending back uh let's see what what what maybe a CSC"
"10-19","17:32","okay now 81 82 is like that so anyway you can see"
"10-19","17:38","the data are bi-directional when you send some data out you are telling"
"10-19","17:44","others this the white the the byte number"
"10-19","17:49","for your data by setting the SQL number so you can see the second number is equal to what okay so if I'm saying six"
"10-19","17:57","number equal to 45 that means I'm sending out the P the letter p"
"10-19","18:03","from inside okay and then the other side from b side uh I"
"10-19","18:10","mean sorry at the same time at the same time a we are also 10 in b"
"10-19","18:15","and in the other side what it is expecting I'm sending you data but I'm also telling you what I'm expecting so"
"10-19","18:21","the expecting part is put into the ack okay so for example I use ack 1079 to"
"10-19","18:29","tell the house B that I'm expecting your bike by 79 sorry"
"10-19","18:36","okay so this is a very simple Talent scenario and later we are going to uh learn more"
"10-19","18:45","about Community basically and I will give you more examples you will understand it's better okay but for now"
"10-19","18:50","you should at least know um how the community basic kids work"
"10-19","18:56","so the next thing I want to discuss very quickly is about the road trip time"
"10-19","19:02","and last time we we actually we mentioned the round trip time it will be"
"10-19","19:08","used to set a timer do you remember we said that when the timer times out we"
"10-19","19:13","will do the resending but how long should we set the timer how long should we set that okay"
"10-19","19:20","if it's such a cute shot it doesn't make much sense and we will have three more"
"10-19","19:26","short timeout do you remember the gift part right I said if you send your friend a gift"
"10-19","19:33","um you will wait for his or her feedback for thank you letter right"
"10-19","19:38","you made me to four two weeks because two weeks is a reasonable round trip time you see the"
"10-19","19:45","gift is traveling to your friend and the latter is traveling from your friend to you right this is called round trip time"
"10-19","19:51","but if you say oh after one hour I will send reason it doesn't make sense"
"10-19","19:57","because this is premature right and you cannot make this too long because if you if you wait for a year okay you are"
"10-19","20:04","risking time right so then usually we need to set this as the"
"10-19","20:10","round trip time but the problem is how do we estimate this round trip time we"
"10-19","20:16","know the round trip time may be affected by many factors I think you still remember the delays and everything we"
"10-19","20:21","learned from the very first chapter right um so then this may vary a lot"
"10-19","20:29","the how do we determine the estimated rtt okay so then a way we can do that is"
"10-19","20:35","we can use okay that means we measure"
"10-19","20:41","um the time from the segment transmission and here of acq received okay and then we matter this time again"
"10-19","20:49","again we get a lot of samples and use these samples we can calculate"
"10-19","20:55","the estimated rtt how do we calculate that so we use something called uh"
"10-19","21:02","exponential weighted moving average okay so this is the formula you can use to"
"10-19","21:09","calculate uh the estimated rtt and it's very interesting as you can see the"
"10-19","21:15","estimated equals to something times the erst estimated RTP again plus I for"
"10-19","21:22","times some party T okay and if you replace this"
"10-19","21:28","with this okay that means you are putting the"
"10-19","21:34","formula into this ads main rtt again again and again and again okay you can"
"10-19","21:39","do this offline and then you will and you will know oh okay eventually"
"10-19","21:45","um eventually this sample rtt the the influence for the sample rtt"
"10-19","21:52","will decrease exponentially fast because these alphons are all numbers smaller"
"10-19","21:59","than one okay so what I'm um what I mean is if this is estimated rtt"
"10-19","22:06","okay estimated rtt actually equal to 1 minus Alpha estimated rtt plus sample"
"10-19","22:15","are alpha times sample rtt okay this actually equals to if you"
"10-19","22:22","replace this one rtt with this entire formula again"
"10-19","22:28","okay because we know rtt equal to this entire volumetric so this is a 1 minus"
"10-19","22:33","Alpha times y minus r for e r t t"
"10-19","22:44","right so this this becomes y minus r for Square"
"10-19","22:58","of course I forgot to do here I missed srtt"
"10-19","23:10","do you see the point so you can continue you can replace this rtt again and again and again and this rtt is always the"
"10-19","23:19","newest rtt and this rtt is the oh the older rtt and it will be older and older"
"10-19","23:26","and older and older right so finally as you can say the rtt is the sample"
"10-19","23:31","architis the influence of it will we the the influence of Parts sample rtts will"
"10-19","23:37","decrease exponentially fast because the rfas rfas are"
"10-19","23:43","smaller than the one so that is how you estimate the rtts okay so you can see in"
"10-19","23:50","the figure the blue uh the blue ones are the some priorities and the pink ones"
"10-19","23:56","are the estimated rtts okay um so just give me one more minute but this"
"10-19","24:03","is not enough because as you can see the some particles are actually still even either bigger or smaller than the"
"10-19","24:09","estimated rtt right if we do not give it a range we know you will always have a"
"10-19","24:16","premature timeout or a too late timeout right so then what we will do is"
"10-19","24:23","actually instead of getting giving it just a one pink line we will give it"
"10-19","24:28","like a band foreign we need to give it some variation to"
"10-19","24:35","cover all the sample artities right or at least most of the sample entities now how do we cover that we add some that uh"
"10-19","24:43","variations okay so how do we calculate the these derivations"
"10-19","24:50","we use similar things we just um we just calculate the derivations okay"
"10-19","24:57","by using the estimated rtt to minus the sum property or some rtt minus that"
"10-19","25:04","immunity is the same thing okay and then based on that we we will also"
"10-19","25:10","do moving Outreach okay it's the same thing it's just similar to this formula but we replace"
"10-19","25:17","the estimated RT with the derivation of rtt okay so then derivation of rtt"
"10-19","25:23","equals to 1 minus beta times derivation rtt plus beta times this is also the"
"10-19","25:29","region of rtt actually this is also deway okay but it's a sample"
"10-19","25:37","sample of derivation quantity because you can see this is sample rtt minus the"
"10-19","25:43","estimated rtt okay and similar similar ways we can calculate the derivation of"
"10-19","25:49","rtt then the real-time interval is actually estimate estimated rtt plus 4"
"10-19","25:56","times derivation of rtt then now we give it a safety margin so it all the data"
"10-19","26:02","all the sample Rarities are covered within this band okay not just one line okay so that is"
"10-19","26:11","how we do the rtt and now you have a sense of how to send the timer so this"
"10-19","26:17","part um for the calculation part you don't need to remember how we do the"
"10-19","26:23","exponential weighted moving average that we are not up here on the test but you"
"10-19","26:28","need to know like the the basic principle of how to set the timer so the"
"10-19","26:34","next thing we are going to discuss is the reliability transfer in TCP um we discussed this relative transfer"
"10-19","26:42","in 3.4 but that is just about the principles uh we want to do this from"
"10-19","26:48","scratch so it's uh it's like the basis for TCP and then for TCP the real"
"10-19","26:54","reliability transfer is based on those principles okay let's look at that"
"10-19","27:00","um so basically TCP creates the reliability transfer service on top of the network"
"10-19","27:07","layers and reliable service okay um and TCP will do pipeline segments do"
"10-19","27:13","you still remember pipeline basically means um instead of sending just one packet at"
"10-19","27:20","one time we send up a number of packets together and then we wait for"
"10-19","27:25","the sdks right so TCP is also using the cumulative AC case"
"10-19","27:31","um and it also has a timer for the oldest and executed package okay"
"10-19","27:38","so the Transmissions may be triggered by time out events when the timer times out"
"10-19","27:45","we do real transmission for this part I think you are very familiar right um but the retransmissions may also be"
"10-19","27:51","triggered by duplicated sdks do remember why we mentioned long time ago we"
"10-19","27:57","mentioned the apple or an example right so we said instead I was saying"
"10-19","28:03","um the current packet is not good we will keep seeing the last packet the"
"10-19","28:09","last package received okay is good right so that means when we receive duplicate"
"10-19","28:15","sdks we may have errors or uh errors in"
"10-19","28:22","the current packet okay um so then in this case we have to do real transmission so pay attention to"
"10-19","28:29","this the real transmission may be triggered by two things either timer expires or duplicate sdks"
"10-19","28:36","okay um now let's consider a simplified TCP sender we ignore the duplicated case and"
"10-19","28:43","we ignore the flow control and congestion control okay let's see what kind of events can happen"
"10-19","28:50","at the center side okay so basically first the data will be"
"10-19","28:56","received from the application layer we know application layer may have a message"
"10-19","29:03","and this message is sent to the transport leader then we need to add some headers we learned this right"
"10-19","29:12","okay um so basically this message is like a"
"10-19","29:18","byte stream okay it contains by a number of bytes okay"
"10-19","29:24","um so then what we do at the transporter layer is we need to create segments with sequence number okay we basically break"
"10-19","29:31","this message into smaller segments okay and then we add hazards to that to those"
"10-19","29:38","smaller pieces for this entire thing we call it a segment"
"10-19","29:43","okay and each segment has a number okay has a sequence number"
"10-19","29:50","uh so the how do we give the secret number do we do one zero one two three four no the sequence number is actually"
"10-19","29:57","the byte stream number of the First Data byte in segment"
"10-19","30:02","so this is very important for example if we have a message like this"
"10-19","30:25","so now we may have a message that has 101 bytes okay so we break it into three"
"10-19","30:32","pieces the first piece the second piece the third piece okay in the first piece"
"10-19","30:38","it's from five zero to by 24. the second piece is from by 25 to byte 27 and the"
"10-19","30:45","third piece is from 28 to 100 okay so now the sequence number for the first"
"10-19","30:52","piece for the first segment is actually zero the sixth number for the second one"
"10-19","30:57","is 25 and the secret number for 31 is 28. that's how we give the sequence"
"10-19","31:03","number okay um it's not from zero one two three is not like that okay"
"10-19","31:10","um and at the center side the center will also start timer if not already running"
"10-19","31:18","um the timer is usually for the oldest and exec kit segment and when the time"
"10-19","31:24","expires um we need to do resending okay so when will these three timer expire the time"
"10-19","31:32","of the interval is this number timeout interval this is what we learned before right so we we basically"
"10-19","31:40","we learned how to set this timeout intro okay"
"10-19","31:45","so um these are the like preparation"
"10-19","31:51","um and uh when they"
"10-19","31:56","when they um sender receive AC Keys okay if this ack acknowledged previously and"
"10-19","32:04","execute assignments okay uh then um the center will update what is known"
"10-19","32:10","to be execated for example if we say we received ack for this first segment then"
"10-19","32:17","the center will update this okay um and if there is there are still an"
"10-19","32:23","executed segments then the sender will start the timer for the uh any secret"
"10-19","32:28","segments okay so those are the events that may happen at the center side"
"10-19","32:34","uh now let's look at an example of the re-transmission okay so firstly we have host a and host"
"10-19","32:42","B okay and host a send out uh segment so the sixth number for this"
"10-19","32:50","segment is 92. it contains eight bytes of data so that means it's a"
"10-19","33:00","it contains basically"
"10-19","33:13","okay it contains 92 to 99 this is a advice of data okay"
"10-19","33:20","then when the host B my husband receives this packet receive this segment host B"
"10-19","33:26","will ack do remember what we learned before about TCP AC kits"
"10-19","33:34","do you remember this part in this part okay basically when we do ack we will we"
"10-19","33:43","will see what we are expecting okay for example here ack 79 basically me"
"10-19","33:49","basically means I'm inspecting your byte 79 so everything before 79 is correct"
"10-19","33:57","now I'm expecting 79 okay similar here ack 43 means I have received everything"
"10-19","34:04","before 43 and now I'm expecting 43. it's like that so"
"10-19","34:11","um so basically when we do the acknowledgment we acknowledge the sequence number our next byte expected"
"10-19","34:18","from the other side so then now let's come back to this example again"
"10-19","34:24","apparently host B has received 92 to 99. and then hospital is now expecting"
"10-19","34:32","the byte 100 that means ack equals to 100 that's why this number is 100 okay"
"10-19","34:41","but unfortunately this uh ack is uh got lost if this is lost we know there is a"
"10-19","34:50","timer for host a right type the timer is for"
"10-19","34:55","this segment so when the timer expires then this host will resend"
"10-19","35:04","this entire segment from 92 to 99 and this time uh has to be still ack 100"
"10-19","35:11","okay of course at the the at Host B it may have received the duplicate package"
"10-19","35:17","duplicate segments right um but uh because it has a secret number"
"10-19","35:23","of 92 so possibly can directly discard the second the second one okay so this"
"10-19","35:29","is the scenario of a lost ack if we look at the scenario of premature timeout"
"10-19","35:35","okay we help host a and hospital again"
"10-19","35:40","um so host a sent out two packets okay firstly from 92 to 999 this is the"
"10-19","35:49","first segment the second segment is from 100"
"10-19","35:57","to 199 or 1 18 sorry okay so the first one"
"10-19","36:03","has eight bytes of data the second segment has 20 bytes of data now we know"
"10-19","36:10","host B when it receives the first piece it will AC key 100 that means I have"
"10-19","36:15","received everything before 100 I'm expecting 100. so husband wait to"
"10-19","36:21","receive the second piece okay it will AC key 120 because everything before 120"
"10-19","36:28","has been received correctly so now we are expecting um the byte 120 okay"
"10-19","36:37","so if the sender didn't set up the timer correctly"
"10-19","36:45","okay then we may have premature time up that means before these AC Keys arrive"
"10-19","36:51","at the center side okay the sender will think oh this"
"10-19","36:57","package got lost so the sender will directly do the resend once the time"
"10-19","37:02","expires okay um so that's why you can see this one is"
"10-19","37:10","recenter Gap okay this one is recent again um of course in um and based on what we"
"10-19","37:19","learned before here when we do the resending we've actually resent uh all"
"10-19","37:24","the packets after that okay that means we also send out sequence"
"10-19","37:30","number equals 100. okay but you must see something very interesting"
"10-19","37:36","at this point okay at this point we know when we do ack"
"10-19","37:42","originally we should do acq 100 right because it's this this segment is from 92 to 99"
"10-19","37:50","so we are expecting 100 so we should ack 100. but you can see the receiver"
"10-19","37:56","actually ack to 120. okay 120 why because we know this is"
"10-19","38:06","cumulative basically okay the receiver will directly say oh I have received"
"10-19","38:12","everything before 120 so you don't need to resend me the"
"10-19","38:19","I wrote 20. okay so that's that's something very interesting and you need to pay"
"10-19","38:25","attention to this this can be uh can become a trap sometimes okay and this"
"10-19","38:31","may appear on the test I may give you some like um uh fails for you to fill in okay so"
"10-19","38:39","you should know uh um how to ack each packet okay"
"10-19","38:46","um and this the third third scenario is also talking about cumulative ack and as"
"10-19","38:53","you can see we have six number 92 it buys data and a second number 125 data"
"10-19","38:59","then for the first piece you can see it's ack 100 and this second piece is executing 120"
"10-19","39:07","okay so although AC key 100 is lost it doesn't really matter at the center"
"10-19","39:13","side okay the center will directly say oh okay um"
"10-19","39:18","we received ack 120 that means the receiver is actually expecting 120 that"
"10-19","39:25","means everything before 120 is correct so the sender doesn't need to resend"
"10-19","39:30","this packet again okay no need to resend this one it will directly send"
"10-19","39:37","um uh send uh the secret number 120 the new"
"10-19","39:42","package okay the new segment uh so in this case as you as you can see although"
"10-19","39:47","some AC Keys get lost okay as long as the last AC key with the biggest number"
"10-19","39:53","is uh received correctly then uh the sender will simply send the new segments"
"10-19","40:00","okay so now let's look at the event at the receiver side"
"10-19","40:05","okay at the receiver side um and the recent recite when the receiver"
"10-19","40:12","re received in order segments with expected sequence number okay"
"10-19","40:20","that means all the data up to the expected signal number um"
"10-19","40:25","uh need to be execated right and um oh sorry they are already execute"
"10-19","40:31","okay so for example now let's see if we have we just now is We Set uh 92"
"10-19","40:40","to 99"
"10-19","40:49","okay so this is the example we just used in this slide right so the first segment"
"10-19","40:55","is from 92 to 99 the second segment is from 100 to 120 okay so the sixth number"
"10-19","41:04","equals to 92"
"10-19","41:14","okay so now let's assume everything before 92"
"10-19","41:19","is correct is received correctly and now we receive the sequence the the packet"
"10-19","41:25","92. okay we receive 92 and what should we do should we directly AC key 100"
"10-19","41:34","we if we educate 100 that means we are actually executing uh this uh first"
"10-19","41:41","segment right but usually we do not do that okay usually the receiver side will"
"10-19","41:47","not do that directly because we know in reality networking the data is sending"
"10-19","41:53","in a super fast speed okay it is very likely that there may be a next segment"
"10-19","42:00","coming in okay then in this case to improve the efficiency usually in the first when we"
"10-19","42:08","received the 92 we will delay this ack we do not directly ack 100 we will wait"
"10-19","42:15","for some time up to 500 Ms for the next"
"10-19","42:21","segment okay if there's no next segment coming in then"
"10-19","42:28","with the ack 100. okay which means it's telling the other"
"10-19","42:33","part oh everything before 100 is correct we are actually executing this one"
"10-19","42:39","okay okay basically in this first segment uh but if there is another segment"
"10-19","42:47","coming in if if this sequence number 100 is coming in this segment coming again then in this case"
"10-19","42:55","um we will actually execute them together okay"
"10-19","43:00","does this make sense so basically when we uh have"
"10-19","43:06","see all the segment coming in okay uh if this is this is the only segment that"
"10-19","43:13","need to be execute usually we will wait for some time and see if we have another segment coming in okay if no then"
"10-19","43:20","reversion ack okay but if for example if this the second one comes in"
"10-19","43:26","okay and the first one is also is already waiting for ack"
"10-19","43:32","okay it needs to be execated then in this case we just combined it to and send one single Community ack together"
"10-19","43:40","so this is the second situation actually okay"
"10-19","43:45","um the third situation is if we are we we receive out order segment higher than"
"10-19","43:51","expected secret number for example if we we are actually expecting 92 but now we"
"10-19","43:57","received 100. okay then in this case we will immediately send a duplicate ack"
"10-19","44:05","indicating the sequence number of the next expected byte okay so in this case"
"10-19","44:11","for example if we are expecting 92 but we receive 100 then we will ack 92 okay"
"10-19","44:19","ack 92 instead of AC King 100 okay um"
"10-19","44:25","so if in the last case if the arrival segments"
"10-19","44:31","um partially or completely fills the Gap then in this case we will immediately"
"10-19","44:37","send the ack okay uh provided that the statement starts at the lower end of the"
"10-19","44:43","Gap it feels some Gap okay then we will execute that so those are all the"
"10-19","44:48","actions that will be taken at the receiver side so another mechanism we are going uh we"
"10-19","44:55","are going to talk about is called uh TCP faster transmit this is very important"
"10-19","45:00","okay we know real transmission can happen in two cases one is time out the"
"10-19","45:07","second one is duplicate AC Keys okay um timeout sometimes is not very"
"10-19","45:14","efficient you think about this okay because we may receive AC Keys super"
"10-19","45:19","fast okay but you have to read for a very long time uh tweet for this timer"
"10-19","45:26","expire okay in this case you are you simply wasting the time okay uh but"
"10-19","45:33","sometimes we we can we can immediately tell there's something wrong with the package because you can receive some"
"10-19","45:40","duplicate AC Keys super fast right so then in this case if we can detect the"
"10-19","45:48","loss segments why duplicate sdks okay in this case the"
"10-19","45:53","sender does not need to wait for the timer to expire okay the sender can"
"10-19","45:59","immediately do the resend okay do the real transmission okay"
"10-19","46:05","as I said here the center often often sends many segments back to back okay if"
"10-19","46:13","segment is lost there will likely be many duplicate sicks okay like like"
"10-19","46:19","um let's see we do not have a good example here but"
"10-19","46:26","um as we said if something is wrong with the current package we may keep uh ack"
"10-19","46:32","in the last one right the last one received okay so if you receive many duplicates sdks that already indicates"
"10-19","46:39","something is wrong with the current segment okay then in this case you don't"
"10-19","46:45","need to wait for the timer to expire you can immediately do the resend okay this"
"10-19","46:51","is called faster transmit okay so for Fastenal transmit uh if the sender"
"10-19","46:58","receives three AC keys for the same data then it will resend the NAC kids segment"
"10-19","47:06","with the smallest sequence number okay"
"10-19","47:12","um so please keep this in mind in the test I may ask you what is the connection for"
"10-19","47:19","TCP real transmission okay so you know the condition is is"
"10-19","47:25","that the sender receives three acks for the same data or the sender received"
"10-19","47:31","through duplicate sdks okay then in this case we will do the root transmission"
"10-19","47:36","you don't need a with one timer okay so as you can see here this is a example"
"10-19","47:43","uh in this example uh we are sending this many packets out okay"
"10-19","47:50","and unfortunately the second one is lost Secrets number 100 is lost"
"10-19","47:56","and then we know Husby went to receive the first piece it will ack 100."
"10-19","48:02","when it receives the third piece the second piece is not received so it has no reaction"
"10-19","48:08","went to receive the third piece it will again ack 100 because there is a gap"
"10-19","48:14","okay because the sequence number 100 is not received yet so no matter how many packets must be"
"10-19","48:21","receives afterwards it will keep continue keep uh keep AC"
"10-19","48:26","King 100. okay in this case at the center side you can see"
"10-19","48:32","um it receives duplicate AC keys okay so uh then in this case the sender don't"
"10-19","48:41","need to wait for the timer because it it did probably a long timer okay and this"
"10-19","48:47","AC case can happen really fast okay and then it will directly do the resending"
"10-19","48:53","of the second segment okay so this is the example"
"10-19","48:59","so the next thing we are"
"10-24","0:04","so the next thing we are going to discuss today is the flow control"
"10-24","0:09","um I mentioned flow control and congestion control uh again and again uh"
"10-24","0:15","and you need to know the difference between them flow control means we don't want to overwhelm the receiver you don't"
"10-24","0:22","want to send data too fast okay too much data too fast then the"
"10-24","0:28","receiver may be overwhelmed um TCP congestion control is different this means the network is probably"
"10-24","0:36","already congested and then we need to slow down the center we need to control"
"10-24","0:41","the speed I'll send you out packets so we don't overwhelm the public network so"
"10-24","0:47","that's the difference of between these two okay so you may ask how do we do the can flow"
"10-24","0:54","control uh in order to know how we do the flow control we need to firstly understand how can the receiver be"
"10-24","1:01","overwhelmed okay so you can see this is a receiver"
"10-24","1:07","okay and again this receiver has all these layers application layer transportedly Network layer Etc okay so"
"10-24","1:15","basically what will happen is you can see from the center side uh so the center will send in packets to"
"10-24","1:23","the receiver right so these are the data payloads okay and you can see uh it has some"
"10-24","1:30","headers here okay the headers may be Network layer header transport layer header Etc okay and then you can see"
"10-24","1:38","when it comes to the network layer Network layer will remove this network layer header"
"10-24","1:44","okay and keep only the transport layer header this is the transport layer header"
"10-24","1:49","and then this network layer will push this to the up layer again okay so to"
"10-24","1:56","remove remove the transport layer header and save the pillow here"
"10-24","2:02","okay then uh here the socket will have a"
"10-24","2:08","buffer do you remember when we write the code for socket programming we have some numbers like"
"10-24","2:14","when you create the socket it has a 1024 or 4000 um"
"10-24","2:21","something 2048 those kind of numbers I told you those are the buffer for the"
"10-24","2:27","socket right so the socket has some buffer to store this uh incoming data"
"10-24","2:33","this incoming packets okay or we call them segments and uh when this data uh are already"
"10-24","2:44","okay so for example if you have those data those segments um that are in order okay from one to"
"10-24","2:51","ten or whatever and then when they are in order then we will send those data up"
"10-24","2:59","to the up layer to the application layer okay so basically the application layer"
"10-24","3:04","process those processes will come to this buffer to get some data"
"10-24","3:11","okay to get some data um but you should know you should know"
"10-24","3:17","when the data is removed when the application is removing the data from"
"10-24","3:23","the TCP socket buffers okay it may be slower than TCP"
"10-24","3:30","receiver is uh delivering the data okay because the sender is keep sending data"
"10-24","3:37","and if this the data are going out slowly slowly okay then this part for me"
"10-24","3:44","become 4. okay it may become full then in this case thus receiver is"
"10-24","3:50","overwhelmed we don't want that to happen okay then you can see the critical part"
"10-24","3:57","here is actually the size of this buffer and the availability of the buffer space"
"10-24","4:04","how much buffer do we still have to store the new incoming data that is the"
"10-24","4:11","key okay so flow control is basically the receiver can choose the sender so"
"10-24","4:17","the sender won't overwhelm the receiver's buffer by transmitting too much too fast that means the receiver"
"10-24","4:25","will stack how much space is still available and tell the sender say hey I"
"10-24","4:31","have only this much space available please do not send me more data than that than that size okay so it's like if I if"
"10-24","4:41","I um tell um the students to say hey I have only"
"10-24","4:48","10 space uh tell the other side whatever the the department say hey I I have only"
"10-24","4:54","10 positions available please do not send me more than 10 students it's like that okay"
"10-24","5:00","so that you can see uh this is the entire buffer for the receiver"
"10-24","5:07","okay and these are the already buffered data so now we still have this much free"
"10-24","5:15","buffer space okay then the receiver will"
"10-24","5:20","tell the sender say hey this is uh the size of my"
"10-24","5:27","available battery space okay please do not send me"
"10-24","5:32","data bigger than that okay more than that so then how could"
"10-24","5:39","this receiver tell the sender the receiver will tell the sender by setting"
"10-24","5:44","this rwnd which is receiving window okay or"
"10-24","5:50","receiver area receiving window okay so where is this rwnd"
"10-24","5:58","okay where is this rwnd if you go to this TCP settlement"
"10-24","6:05","structure okay this is the segment structure that is used by the both the center and"
"10-24","6:11","receiver okay they will communicate in this way and here you can see something"
"10-24","6:17","like foreign"
"10-24","6:24","do you see this one receive window okay this one is actually the rwnd"
"10-24","6:34","is the receive window okay that means the number of bytes"
"10-24","6:39","receiver we need to accept then you can see actually when the receiver responds"
"10-24","6:45","to the sender it will also set this rwnd then the sender will check this rwnd and"
"10-24","6:53","the center will immediately know how much data it should send okay so this is how the rwnd is set"
"10-24","7:06","okay so as you can see here the receiver advertises free Perfect Space by"
"10-24","7:12","including rwnd value in the TCP header of the receiver to Sender segments okay"
"10-24","7:20","um it's in the response segments actually okay the receive buffer size is"
"10-24","7:25","set while the socket options okay and actually many uh operating systems they"
"10-24","7:32","will directly adjust the receive buffer so basically it's a receiver we know"
"10-24","7:39","it's this entire thing okay the operating system May adjust this receive buffer okay and you can also set this"
"10-24","7:48","receive buffer uh wires the socket options as what we have done before okay"
"10-24","7:53","and then when the sender receives this rwnd the center will limit the amount of"
"10-24","7:59","an AC kit in Flight data to the receiver's rwne value"
"10-24","8:06","okay that means if RW of ND equal to four thousand"
"10-24","8:11","okay then the center will have at most 4 000 vital data in flight"
"10-24","8:20","okay so this guarantees the receiver uh we are not be overwhelmed okay"
"10-24","8:28","any questions so far"
"10-24","8:34","all right okay so we will continue to discuss the connection management plan so today we are very efficient"
"10-24","8:43","um so for connection management uh connection basically means establishing"
"10-24","8:50","a connection between before the data exchange we mentioned this uh again again right so we said for UDP we do not"
"10-24","8:58","need to make any connection before date exchange but for TCP we all need that"
"10-24","9:04","then how do we establish a connection okay we said we will do something called"
"10-24","9:09","through V handshake so basically the client and the serversy high high to each other okay it's like that"
"10-24","9:16","um so basically um before exchanging the data the sender"
"10-24","9:23","and receiver will do some handshaking they agree to establish a connection and"
"10-24","9:28","each each knowing the other willing to establish connection okay and they also"
"10-24","9:34","agree on connection parameters okay do you remember I mentioned before"
"10-24","9:40","um the first sequence number first AC key number Etc so those those parameters"
"10-24","9:45","are actually negotiated during the established connection part okay so"
"10-24","9:51","basically the socket the uh one side will establish a client"
"10-24","9:57","socket and the other side will agree to accept this connection okay do"
"10-24","10:06","you remember this connection socket okay so the connection socket"
"10-24","10:12","um we learned basically two type of sockets several sockets at the"
"10-24","10:18","TCP socket programming right so we said there is a welcoming socket which is the"
"10-24","10:24","server socket uh that welcoming socket we are basically um accept the connection and then later"
"10-24","10:33","it will create a different type of socket which is actually doing the real"
"10-24","10:40","business to help the clients to deal with the client's request so in the midterm exam we also have that question"
"10-24","10:46","how many types of uh server socket will be established at the"
"10-24","10:53","um uh in the TCP right at the server side and we said actually there are at"
"10-24","10:59","least two types okay so let's first look at the established"
"10-24","11:07","connection part how do we establish a connection so a very simple way is to do a three a tooling handshake actually"
"10-24","11:14","okay so for example for human being uh you can just say uh say hey let's talk"
"10-24","11:21","okay and then the receiver will say okay sure let's talk okay so then this"
"10-24","11:26","connection is established um this will work perfectly in human"
"10-24","11:33","society because humans can see each other okay they can see each other they can"
"10-24","11:39","um they can they can sense each other okay but this will not work in"
"10-24","11:47","um Network okay because in networking um the two parties cannot really see"
"10-24","11:55","each other okay and they do not know what is happening at the other side"
"10-24","12:01","okay so then if we do two-way handshake we may run into problems so let's see"
"10-24","12:08","why let's see some of the village scenarios for example let's say the this machine clients say choose our"
"10-24","12:16","X and say hey can I is that my connection with you and then the server will say sure let's connect"
"10-24","12:23","okay it seems good right but okay"
"10-24","12:29","and also after some time okay after some time and these two these two machines uh"
"10-24","12:36","after the connection is complete then then the client side will terminate and the server side will simply sketch this"
"10-24","12:42","connection okay but what if what if for example"
"10-24","12:49","um this kind of side may think this one"
"10-24","12:54","this one is not sent correctly okay then the server the client side may"
"10-24","13:00","do a real transmission okay so for example let's say maybe the AC"
"10-24","13:06","case is lost or whatever okay so then this can I started with me maybe uh"
"10-24","13:12","maybe uh doing a re-transmission but this real transmission unfortunately finally comes to the"
"10-24","13:20","server side after this termination is done"
"10-24","13:26","okay but at the server side the suicide doesn't know this is a re-transmission"
"10-24","13:32","it will think oh there is a new request coming okay and then the server side let me say"
"10-24","13:39","oh let's establish a connection okay but actually the client is already"
"10-24","13:45","gone okay so that in this case you can see"
"10-24","13:50","um it's actually a half open connection there's no client there is only the"
"10-24","13:57","server there hoping the client is there but the client is actually already gone okay we didn't get any confirmation from"
"10-24","14:04","the client so this is actually a failure scenario okay"
"10-24","14:09","um another scenario is actually about the uh also similar okay so for example"
"10-24","14:15","in this case um this client said can we can we connect"
"10-24","14:20","okay so we'll see yes let's connect okay and then client began to send the data"
"10-24","14:25","and then the server accepts data very happy right everybody's happy and I"
"10-24","14:31","after everything's down determine this connection okay"
"10-24","14:36","but in this entire process again we may have lost AC Keys okay we may have"
"10-24","14:43","timers timers times out okay then the client side will client sign doesn't"
"10-24","14:50","know what has happened at the receiver side right so client designer will say oh let me do re-transmission because"
"10-24","14:58","maybe the server didn't receive my request so it did a real transmission of this"
"10-24","15:05","connection request and also did a real transmission of the data okay again those requests and the data"
"10-24","15:13","may arrive at the server side only after the connection is completed okay after"
"10-24","15:19","this is terminated then at the server side the server will feel like oh a"
"10-24","15:25","client is uh um requesting to establish connection and also even better a client is sending"
"10-24","15:34","data so the server feel like it's talking to a real live"
"10-24","15:40","client but actually there's no client okay the server is actually only talking"
"10-24","15:47","to itself okay so that is the problem of the"
"10-24","15:52","two-way handshake that's why this fails okay so that's why in reality instead of"
"10-24","15:59","doing two way we will do survey we will get the confirmation from a client again to make sure both parties are still"
"10-24","16:05","there okay so basically what will happen is the client avails client side will"
"10-24","16:12","send an initial request with a sequence number X this is negotiated and a same"
"10-24","16:18","bit set to one sim bit set to one means I want to establish connection with you"
"10-24","16:24","okay so where is the same bit if you look at"
"10-24","16:30","this TCP segment structure again"
"10-24","16:36","okay so this is the same bit s is the same bit okay there is actually"
"10-24","16:44","also F beat for finish okay finish and we also have a bit right ack so these"
"10-24","16:52","are all the bits that may be used to establish the connection okay and keep that in mind the same bit is something"
"10-24","16:59","real it's not what we um made up okay"
"10-24","17:06","okay so send a scene bit means I want to establish a request a connection with"
"10-24","17:11","you this is request and then the server side will reply with a simple equal to"
"10-24","17:18","one I see K bit equal to one so both the C and ack in set to 1 means the server"
"10-24","17:23","agrees to establish the connection okay of course the sequence number is uh also"
"10-24","17:29","set and chosen by the um the server side so the AC key number"
"10-24","17:35","equals to X plus one because this means I have already received your apps and I'm expecting X plus one now okay but"
"10-24","17:43","that's not important the most important thing is you should know that in the reply c equal to 1 is equal to one here"
"10-24","17:50","is c equal to one and a c k equal to zero foreign"
"10-24","18:01","number okay and then the client will reply with the"
"10-24","18:07","ack bit equal to one and same bit equals"
"10-24","18:13","to zero okay so these are the numbers that will be set in the three handshake so in this"
"10-24","18:19","way uh basically the client answer already confirms with each other that they are willing to establish the"
"10-24","18:25","connection okay so that is a theory handshake and TCP may also close a connection"
"10-24","18:32","after everything is done okay so how do we close the connection basically the"
"10-24","18:38","the client will say hey I want to break up with you think BT equal to one okay"
"10-24","18:44","and then this the server will say okay I agree"
"10-24","18:50","okay but the server will also see to confirm with you I also want to break"
"10-24","18:55","out with you okay break up with you so then the client will also say okay I"
"10-24","19:02","confirm okay with AC KB is equal to one uh"
"10-24","19:07","usually these two these two can be sent in just one respond this two can be"
"10-24","19:14","um combined with combined which means the server while it is AC key uh the uh"
"10-24","19:22","connection finished request from the client it also tells the client that I"
"10-24","19:28","also want to break up with you okay I also want to finish this connection and"
"10-24","19:33","then the the client will ack and then finally they will just close this"
"10-24","19:40","connection okay so this is the entire process um all right so we finished 3.5 today we"
"10-24","19:47","will continue to discuss the congestion control of TCP okay"
"10-24","19:52","um so let me firstly remind you again about the difference between flow"
"10-24","19:58","control and congestion control last time away uh discussed the flow control flow"
"10-24","20:04","control is not to overwhelm the receiver so how do we do the control basically"
"10-24","20:09","the receiver is controlling the sender by setting the rwnd do you still"
"10-24","20:16","remember setting the receiving window right so that basically the receiver is"
"10-24","20:21","telling the sender hey I have only this many buffer space so please do not send"
"10-24","20:29","more than that um right so for example if the rwmb is 4000 that means uh the sender can at"
"10-24","20:36","most have four thousand um and AC kit Buys in Flight okay"
"10-24","20:43","so that is the flow control and then uh congestion control as I said is actually"
"10-24","20:50","uh not to overwhelm the network okay so informally congestion means too many"
"10-24","20:56","sources sending too much data too fast for Network to handle"
"10-24","21:03","um and then basically the manifestations are lost packets or long delays okay so"
"10-24","21:12","if you say a long delay um for the package then that means there is"
"10-24","21:19","congestion or even worse you may experience lost packets okay that's"
"10-24","21:24","because the buffer is overflowed at the router okay so congestion control is"
"10-24","21:30","still a top 10 problem for networking okay and"
"10-24","21:36","um researchers and the industry are working hard on this"
"10-24","21:41","um so before we um think about how to do congestion control we need to firstly understand"
"10-24","21:48","why we need to congest control so what is the reason behind Okay"
"10-24","21:55","um so now let's look at a very simple example here we have host a"
"10-24","22:02","and we have probably a server here okay and we also have a host B and another"
"10-24","22:08","server here we'll assume there are two senders and two receivers in this scenario okay and then the host a and"
"10-24","22:16","host B the share um"
"10-24","22:21","router okay but all their pack is how to go through this router okay and we at"
"10-24","22:27","the very beginning you assume this router has unlimited buffer space unlimited buffer space basically means"
"10-24","22:34","there will never be buffer overflow that means there will never be dropped packets all the packets will finally be"
"10-24","22:42","delivered right so then if we have no dropped package then that means we do not need to have"
"10-24","22:49","any re-transmission because no pack is allowed I lost all the packages will be"
"10-24","22:54","delivered so why do we need to do recognition right um"
"10-24","22:59","then that is a scenario one and then in this scenario we uh assume we have we"
"10-24","23:07","have Lambda in and the Lambda out so what is this um so this is basically the uh"
"10-24","23:15","throughput okay uh or we you can think it has a the"
"10-24","23:21","data sending rate or transmitting rate uh then none out is like the data"
"10-24","23:27","receiving rate okay um so now let's look at the relationship"
"10-24","23:32","between Lambda e and lamb out okay so here is the one"
"10-24","23:39","um the figure you can see as usually as Lambda e increases"
"10-24","23:45","okay Lambda out will also increase this is not this is actually very straightforward very easy to understand"
"10-24","23:52","um basically if host a is sending more data at a faster speed then of course at this"
"10-24","24:02","side at the output we will receive more data as a faster speed right so it's"
"10-24","24:07","like that but you need to pay attention uh because"
"10-24","24:12","although this this router has unlimited buffer but the out the"
"10-24","24:18","um the output link okay from A and B the total capacity is R okay the total"
"10-24","24:25","capacity is r that means for each one of them they can at most have a half hour"
"10-24","24:32","okay they can at mostly use half a wall for the um for the link capacity okay or for the"
"10-24","24:39","bandwidth okay so it's like in total the bandwidth is R then each route can have at only at"
"10-24","24:49","most half of the bandwidth okay so that's why as you can see when the"
"10-24","24:54","Lambda e increased to the point of half of our the Lambda out will not increase"
"10-24","25:00","anymore it becomes constant okay it can at most be half hour"
"10-24","25:08","okay that is the reason and if you look at at look at the delays"
"10-24","25:16","then the delay will also increase but when it approaches half overall which"
"10-24","25:21","means this round is very very busy now then the delay will increase"
"10-24","25:27","significantly okay so that is the relationship between Lambda e and Lambda out and again in"
"10-24","25:35","this scenario we assume there uh the buffer at the router is unlimited okay"
"10-24","25:42","so the Lambda out will increase as Lambda e increase but reach a maximum of"
"10-24","25:49","half hour sorry uh half hour okay"
"10-24","25:56","so that is scenario one for scenario two we assume we have uh"
"10-24","26:02","Affinity buffer okay so finish the buffer basically"
"10-24","26:07","means uh now the the router the router have"
"10-24","26:14","a limited buffer then if we have too many packets coming in okay the buffer"
"10-24","26:22","can cannot hold that many packets when the buffer is a full then we will have"
"10-24","26:27","the router will have to drop some packets okay in this case if the packets"
"10-24","26:33","are dropped okay in order to ensure the same Lambda"
"10-24","26:38","out say the same effective output we have to do some reasoning at the transport layer"
"10-24","26:46","do remember uh the reliable data transfer we have learned just now not"
"10-24","26:52","just now actually in the previous classes we have learned uh the reliability transfer protocol and we"
"10-24","26:59","set usually when the data packets are lost what will happen is the sender side"
"10-24","27:06","will keep a timer right so the timer expires and then we do the resending"
"10-24","27:14","okay so this happens at the transporter layer so that's why you can see here we"
"10-24","27:22","have Lambda in this is application layer and the Lambda M Prime this is at the"
"10-24","27:29","transport layer which means they are different okay they are different"
"10-24","27:34","um if this network is very busy to reach the same Lambda out usually"
"10-24","27:42","Lambda in Prime has to be bigger than Lambda e why because for example let me"
"10-24","27:51","say okay we want to send application layer data for example if this this data"
"10-24","27:56","is ABCD we send four bytes okay and then let's assume now we are sending"
"10-24","28:04","ABCD okay as application layer we are sending"
"10-24","28:10","these four levels then as a transporter layer okay one ABCD are sent out if this"
"10-24","28:17","network is very busy and if this buffer is full then some of the letters may be"
"10-24","28:23","dropped okay so maybe B is dropped the C dropped okay then in order to to deliver"
"10-24","28:31","this data rely in a reliable way we have to resend the B again at transport layer"
"10-24","28:39","okay the first B and recent B and at and for C the same thing recent C again okay"
"10-24","28:46","sometimes we may do even resend the D if if we are using some protocols let's go"
"10-24","28:53","back in okay of course if we are using select to repeat that we"
"10-24","28:58","may do um we may only resend B and C okay but"
"10-24","29:04","anyway here let's assume we only use that b and c but now you can say in order to receive"
"10-24","29:12","a b c d correctly here at the lemon out okay and output we have to do summary"
"10-24","29:19","sending at the transport layer okay and these resoundings are not necessary okay I'm"
"10-24","29:29","not actually ideally we don't we don't want to have this right"
"10-24","29:36","um but then based on this you can see okay Lambda in Prime is usually bigger than the Lambda e okay so that means so"
"10-24","29:46","I have already mentioned this but I want you to see this animation we have free powerful space then it is"
"10-24","29:54","fine okay"
"10-24","29:59","so that in this case in this case it's not busy and it's not busy yet okay so"
"10-24","30:08","so then you can see laminating increases and then Lambda out also"
"10-24","30:14","increase this is uh the idea um situation where we have perfect"
"10-24","30:19","knowledge we know okay sometimes uh we know when the buffer is available"
"10-24","30:25","then we do the sending okay but in reality is oh another situation is we know the loss"
"10-24","30:32","okay we know when the loss happens no buffering space okay it's dropped"
"10-24","30:39","and then we have to send it again"
"10-24","30:48","okay so in this case you can see the lamina in Prime is uh"
"10-24","30:54","near is almost the same as Lambda out because"
"10-24","30:59","we know when the loss will happen Okay and we will do the re redelivery or re"
"10-24","31:06","sorry resending only when loss happens okay this actually this is still ideal"
"10-24","31:13","situation but in real life reality okay in reality we don't know if the packets are lost or"
"10-24","31:20","not maybe the ABCD has already been received but we just don't know okay"
"10-24","31:27","maybe the AC keys are lost right so we don't know and sometimes"
"10-24","31:33","select this"
"10-24","31:39","okay so let me repeat"
"10-24","31:55","okay so this is a you can see in this case we do not have any loss of data"
"10-24","32:02","okay but still the center did the resending okay uh maybe ABCD has already"
"10-24","32:08","been have already been received but still the sender May resend some uh data"
"10-24","32:14","okay so in this case in this case the relationship between land in Prime and"
"10-24","32:21","Lambda out is like this okay even in order to reach"
"10-24","32:27","this effective land out we have to work a lot we have to make laminating Prime"
"10-24","32:35","this big okay so this is the the third case uh in"
"10-24","32:41","this case when we have no loss okay when we have no loss basically if we have for"
"10-24","32:47","example a c d is received we know B is uh lost so we only resend B okay"
"10-24","32:55","then um in this case I mean it's although it's not ideal but still it's near"
"10-24","33:02","perfect okay in reality is not that perfect that's why as you can see we see"
"10-24","33:08","a figure like this okay that means okay for scenario two let me summarize"
"10-24","33:15","although we talked about a lot but the takeaway message is"
"10-24","33:21","more work is needed for giving good food"
"10-24","33:30","okay and we have a lot of unneeded re-transmissions okay the link May"
"10-24","33:39","carries may carry multiple copies over the packet okay so that is actually the number one"
"10-24","33:47","reason for congestion why do we have congestion because for a"
"10-24","33:55","given good put there are a lot of re-transmissions"
"10-24","34:01","these retransmissions may or may not be and needed"
"10-24","34:07","okay so that this re-transmission retransmitted package will consume the"
"10-24","34:14","resources on the network okay those link the links Network links has to carry"
"10-24","34:20","this uh multiple copies of targets that's why we have a congestion number"
"10-24","34:26","one reason for congestion"
"10-24","34:38","okay this is scenario two and now let's look at scenario three we"
"10-24","34:44","just found out one reason for congestion actually there are still more reasons okay so let's look at congest scenario"
"10-24","34:51","third in this scenario we have host a house B host D and host C here okay and"
"10-24","35:00","interestingly pay attention host a is actually communicating with host c not"
"10-24","35:06","host B if you if you follow this red route here okay the red route here"
"10-24","35:13","actually the host a is communicating with host C and if you follow this round"
"10-24","35:19","here for host d okay then you can see host D is actually communicating with"
"10-24","35:25","host B okay and again they share this uh"
"10-24","35:32","router okay um and now what we want to look at is this"
"10-24","35:40","Lambda in and this Lambda out okay so pay attention we are looking at"
"10-24","35:45","this Lambda in and this Lambda out they belong to different rows"
"10-24","35:52","not this Lambda out no okay why do we study the alumni and lamb"
"10-24","36:00","out from different routes because we want to learn the interactions between these two"
"10-24","36:06","rows okay so let's make me make this easier"
"10-24","36:12","okay so what will happen as Lambda in increase"
"10-24","36:18","as we can imagine as laminating increase the limited employment will also increase"
"10-24","36:24","okay and at the same time the input at the hospitality will also increase"
"10-24","36:30","so then what you will see is is like Lambda increases so lemon out also"
"10-24","36:36","increases because they are all increasing okay okay but"
"10-24","36:43","at one point because these two rounds share this buffer okay share this buffer at one"
"10-24","36:50","point this buffer may get four Okay negative four then we have a"
"10-24","36:56","problem now okay we have problem because this buffer is a four so the battery will begin to drop packets"
"10-24","37:03","okay but the question the problem is host a you can see if host a and host d"
"10-24","37:11","if they all send the same the package at the same time okay if we are seeing X"
"10-24","37:18","and Y okay so X and Y which packet will arrive at this"
"10-24","37:25","router faster apparently X will arrive at this buffer"
"10-24","37:32","faster why because you can see y has to go through"
"10-24","37:38","also this router so why is falling away from this"
"10-24","37:45","router okay so X is closer so that's why X can"
"10-24","37:50","arrive faster okay the the problem is if we have only limited space at this"
"10-24","37:57","router R let's see okay this is R1 R2 okay at around R1 if we have a limited"
"10-24","38:06","space then X will arrive faster so we can still accommodate X okay but y will"
"10-24","38:14","arrive late so we have to drop y because we do not have space for y anymore"
"10-24","38:21","okay then this is actually a very sad story why because you can see this package y"
"10-24","38:28","actually travels a long way from host d two"
"10-24","38:34","finally R1 but Y is killed here"
"10-24","38:40","okay Y is killed here then in this case y cannot reach the destination B okay it already it already"
"10-24","38:50","used a lot of resources before R1 for example it already consumes the resource"
"10-24","38:55","at R2 okay but finally it doesn't arrive at"
"10-24","39:01","the destination we can see this is a Visa resource okay this is a with resource for packing"
"10-24","39:08","y okay so that's actually the number two reason"
"10-24","39:13","for the congestion"
"10-24","39:26","the number two reason is when a package is dropped"
"10-24","39:32","any Upstream transmission capacity used for that packet was wasted"
"10-24","39:40","okay when Y is dropped all the capacities we have used before"
"10-24","39:47","reaching R1 okay is wasted okay so that is the number two reason"
"10-24","39:55","for congestion and some of you may want to know why do we have this figure actually as you can see as Lambda in"
"10-24","40:02","Prime increases Lambda out is increasing at the very beginning okay so as uh this"
"10-24","40:09","one is this one is increasing and the hosty is also in sending data faster so"
"10-24","40:15","so that's why Lambda out is increasing but at some point okay when they all"
"10-24","40:21","reach a big number then the the pack is from host a we all have more privilege"
"10-24","40:30","because it's closer to R1 so that's why when Lambda is increasing again then"
"10-24","40:37","Lambda out will be will be decreased because"
"10-24","40:42","all the packets from host D are throttled at this point okay and R1"
"10-24","40:48","so that's why you can see as laminate is increasing actually it it begins to"
"10-24","40:55","like it is competing with the the the the blue route here right so that's why"
"10-24","41:03","you can see the Lambda actually decrease significantly okay we talked about a lot okay I don't"
"10-24","41:11","expect you to remember the relationship between London England Prime Lambda out"
"10-24","41:16","Etc okay I only need you to remember the reasons for congestion I will test the"
"10-24","41:24","reasons okay for the congestion number one"
"10-24","41:30","reason is because for a given good put we have"
"10-24","41:35","to do a lot of re-transmissions those retransmissions will consume the network"
"10-24","41:42","bandwidth that is number one reason number two reason is when a packet is"
"10-24","41:48","dropped all the Upstream transmission capacity used for that package was"
"10-24","41:53","already listed okay that is the number two reason so those are the two reasons"
"10-24","41:59","for congestions and I may ask you this question in the test what are the two reasons for congestion"
"10-24","42:05","okay so you need to know that um"
"10-24","42:10","and"
"10-26","0:03","um and there there were some approaches towards uh there are some approaches for"
"10-26","0:09","congestion control okay so these two here releases are the two commonly used"
"10-26","0:16","approaches one is called end-to-end congestion control this means we do not get any"
"10-26","0:23","explicit feedback from the network no feedback from the network okay now how"
"10-26","0:30","do we know the congestion how do we know the status of the network what we can do is we infer the"
"10-26","0:37","congestion from the end system by observing the loss and delays okay"
"10-26","0:44","it's like if your mom observes that you arrived at home late then your mom may"
"10-26","0:51","say oh there is congestion on the road okay it's like that so this is actually the approach taken by TCP"
"10-26","0:58","okay another type of congestion control is called Network assess assisted"
"10-26","1:04","congestion control uh in this method the routers will provide feedback to the end"
"10-26","1:11","systems so basically there there are some bits indicating the congestion"
"10-26","1:17","okay um and also uh"
"10-26","1:23","um yeah this piece basically will be sent for example beside to one to tell uh the"
"10-26","1:31","sender say hey uh there's a congestion okay so it's like that"
"10-26","1:36","um let's say maybe this is actually this is a this one is used in TCP and this"
"10-26","1:44","one is actually not um use the very commonly at the current"
"10-26","1:50","Network okay the current Network um but I I want to maybe quickly discuss"
"10-26","1:56","this this will not appear on the test but I want I want to want you to understand how this congestion control"
"10-26","2:03","was done before okay so firstly we have something called ABR"
"10-26","2:08","which is available bitreach okay um"
"10-26","2:14","so let's see so if the central path is under loaded"
"10-26","2:20","the sender should use the available bandwidth if the center part is congested then the center will be"
"10-26","2:26","throttle to a minimum Guaranteed Rate okay and then there"
"10-26","2:32","in the communication between two parties in addition to the data cells the data"
"10-26","2:39","cells will carry the data we will also have those cells called Resource Management cells okay those Resource"
"10-26","2:46","Management cells are sent by the sender interspersed with the dead cells okay"
"10-26","2:54","um and then there are some bits in the RM cell resource matter myself"
"10-26","3:00","um so for example no increase speeds a night beat or a CI beat which means"
"10-26","3:07","congestion indication okay so uh these RM cells will travel together with the"
"10-26","3:15","data and then um what will happen let's look at this"
"10-26","3:21","okay so you can see the white ones I did the cells the red ones are Resource Management cells so those cells will"
"10-26","3:28","travel together okay um"
"10-26","3:33","so there is a two byte ER rate field"
"10-26","3:39","so er is a explicit to read okay then"
"10-26","3:44","this number will if for example if if this uh um"
"10-26","3:50","cell comes to a router and this router is very busy okay it's very busy then"
"10-26","3:58","um this router May deduct some number"
"10-26","4:03","okay deduct some number to make this er a smaller value"
"10-26","4:10","okay um and then find when when it comes to"
"10-26","4:16","another router if it's not busy then we do not change the ER but if the second"
"10-26","4:21","round trip is also busy then again this error will be deducted okay your value will be deducted so finally we're going"
"10-26","4:28","to reach reaches the uh the receiver okay then we get a"
"10-26","4:35","we get this then we will get to know um what how congested this network is"
"10-26","4:43","okay and then there is also the efci bit in the data cells okay in the data cells"
"10-26","4:51","we have the efci bits okay so this speed is set to 1 in the congestive switch"
"10-26","4:59","okay so you can see um we have RM cells we also have bits in"
"10-26","5:05","the data cells so all those data combined together will tell the we'll"
"10-26","5:11","we'll um finally reach the receiver and then the receiver will send this feedback to"
"10-26","5:18","the sender to tell the sender say hey you need to slow down okay so it's like that this was how congestion control was"
"10-26","5:25","done before okay it's not very common but I want to show you how congestion"
"10-26","5:32","control is done in TCP okay as I said this part"
"10-26","5:41","okay I will not test this on the on the test"
"10-26","5:48","okay"
"10-26","6:02","okay but for TCP congestion control I will definitely have a test"
"10-26","6:08","okay yes by uh we have a question by cells are you referring to packets yes yes"
"10-26","6:16","here this uh there are packets but we have different kind of packets some packets are for data some packets are"
"10-26","6:22","for resource management okay so how do we do uh congestion control in"
"10-26","6:30","TCP okay uh it's actually very interesting the approach taken by TCP is"
"10-26","6:38","called addictive increase and multiplicative decrease okay so basically the center of your"
"10-26","6:46","increase to the transmission rate gradually the transmission rate here means the window size okay the sender's"
"10-26","6:54","window size so if the window size is 2000 that that means we can have two"
"10-26","6:59","thousand in-flight bytes if it's 4 000 that means we can have 4 000 in-flight"
"10-26","7:05","bytes okay so basically the center will increase this transmission rate gradually"
"10-26","7:11","probing for usable bandwidth until loss occurs okay when loss occurs"
"10-26","7:19","then um we can do multiplicative decrease we want to decrease as fast as possible"
"10-26","7:26","okay to decrease to a very low number so to improve the condition uh quickly okay"
"10-26","7:32","so that's what we do for example we can say this is a cwnd CW indeed is the"
"10-26","7:39","congestion window size okay so then it is increasing gradually and if we see a"
"10-26","7:47","loss here then we will do multiplicative decrease so it decreases to half of that"
"10-26","7:54","number so then it will increase again and may have lost we cut to half again"
"10-26","8:01","okay and increase gradually again so finally you can see some kind of a"
"10-26","8:07","Sawtooth Behavior okay so this is this is like the basic"
"10-26","8:14","principle approach okay um so then some of you may ask what is cwnd"
"10-26","8:22","as we said the cwnd is the congestion window okay so it's just the window size"
"10-26","8:29","we learned before for go back and select repeat and for TCP okay so basically we"
"10-26","8:36","want to make sure the last bite is sent this is the last bison minus the last"
"10-26","8:43","byte AC kit okay this number is smaller or equal to CW and D that is basically"
"10-26","8:51","means uh we have we can have at most this many CW and D bytes our data and a"
"10-26","8:58","secret okay so CWD is dynamic um"
"10-26","9:05","um is a dynamic function of perceived Network congestion okay so basically"
"10-26","9:11","then the TCP sending rate can be roughly like CW and D over rtt bytes per second"
"10-26","9:18","why because as we said so we we uh we have to we can have at"
"10-26","9:26","most cwnd by Sol data in flight so that then how much time do we need to"
"10-26","9:33","finish this entire from this uh for the for these bytes we have to use rtt time"
"10-26","9:39","right so the data arrive at the the receiver or the receiver send feedback and then we can send another"
"10-26","9:46","cwnd by sub data okay so that's why the transmission rate is like cwnd over rtt"
"10-26","9:54","okay um"
"10-26","10:00","so then for the TCP you can see how originally we said it is a increasing"
"10-26","10:08","gradually right the CWD is increasing by one uh"
"10-26","10:14","MSS every rtt so it means at the beginning we have one then we have two"
"10-26","10:20","then we have three we send a one package two packets three packages like that so here YMS means maximum"
"10-26","10:30","segment size okay"
"10-26","10:37","so it means every time we just increase one package but in reality in reality in TCP we we"
"10-26","10:45","do not do that we actually what we do is we do this exponentially so and the"
"10-26","10:52","first time we will send one segment second time mission two and third time"
"10-26","10:58","representative four the next time you can send eight okay we do"
"10-26","11:03","um we increase this read exponentially and here the loss happens"
"10-26","11:09","okay so this phase is called slow start okay slow start"
"10-26","11:17","and then if we have lots of packets okay"
"10-26","11:22","the loss of package may be indicated by timeout if the timer times out"
"10-26","11:30","so uh this indicates loss right so uh it"
"10-26","11:36","may also be indicated by Third duplicate AC keys do you remember the fast rear"
"10-26","11:42","transmission so if we keep receiving duplicates duplicate sdks that means something is"
"10-26","11:49","wrong with the current package do you still remember that the apple or an example right"
"10-26","11:55","so then for these two cases the loss can be indicated by either time out or"
"10-26","12:02","duplicate executes so I would say duplicate it is the case may actually"
"10-26","12:08","indicates the congestion is not very serious"
"10-26","12:13","why because the AC keys can still come through right it can still arrive at the"
"10-26","12:18","center side but if you have time out usually the congestion is already very serious"
"10-26","12:26","because there is even no feedback coming back okay so that's why if we have a loss"
"10-26","12:33","indicated by timeout the cwme will be directly set to one no"
"10-26","12:41","matter what is the current number if the current number is doubling is equal to 100"
"10-26","12:46","I don't care I just directly send it to one if there is a loss happening if if"
"10-26","12:51","we if we find some time out okay then the window growth exponentially to the"
"10-26","12:58","threshold and then grow linearly so how do we set this threshold"
"10-26","13:04","I'll explain this later your threshold is half of the window uh when congestion happens okay"
"10-26","13:13","um so let's look at one example"
"10-26","13:19","let's look at one example so"
"10-26","13:26","maybe let's finish this first let's finish this line and I'll explain example okay so if the loss is indicated"
"10-26","13:33","by three duplicate sdks then what we will do is um we cut the cwnd to half and then grow"
"10-26","13:42","linearly okay so this is called TCP Renault but TCP Tahoe is uh"
"10-26","13:49","means we always set CW and D to one no matter if the loss is indicated by time"
"10-26","13:55","out or through duplicate uh packets okay through duplicate AC keys"
"10-26","14:02","um so this TCP random and TCP Tahoe are the two modes that we may use okay so"
"10-26","14:10","then let's look at an example I know probably you feel like overwhelmed what does this mean okay so this basically"
"10-26","14:17","means at the very beginning"
"10-26","14:22","the cwnd is set to 1. okay which means each time we send out"
"10-26","14:28","only one packet and then we increase it to two then we double it to four we"
"10-26","14:35","double it to eight okay and here we reach a point this is"
"10-26","14:41","called a threshold so what is threshold threshold is usually half of the"
"10-26","14:49","previous uh um window size when congestion happens so"
"10-26","14:56","for example originally maybe this is 16 okay the middle size is 16. and then we"
"10-26","15:04","found loss okay the loss may be indicated by"
"10-26","15:10","timeout or through duplicate sdks so we find the laws okay then we decrease this"
"10-26","15:16","to one okay and now this is uh actually when it"
"10-26","15:22","increases to half of half of this window size okay then 16 divided by 2 equal to"
"10-26","15:29","8. then because last time we know at 16 we have"
"10-26","15:36","congestion so that's why now when we increase to eight we begin to be very carefully we"
"10-26","15:43","don't want to double again because if you double again the eight doubles becomes 16 is"
"10-26","15:50","congestion again right so we want to avoid the congestion that's why we will"
"10-26","15:56","increase linearly instead of exponentially so that's why we will have nine"
"10-26","16:03","ten eleven twelve now let's see if we have lost again"
"10-26","16:10","at this point okay and then next what you can choose is you can choose either the TCP Tahoe or TCP"
"10-26","16:19","Renault so if you choose TCP uh Tahoe then you will need to decrease this"
"10-26","16:27","directly to one again okay and they will double so one two"
"10-26","16:35","four the next one cannot be eight because what because now you can see"
"10-26","16:40","this is a CW and D equals to 12. so half of 12 is"
"10-26","16:47","six so we cannot make it eight we have to stop here at six that's why this"
"10-26","16:53","threshold is equal to six now is a half of 12 okay so then after that again you"
"10-26","17:00","will increase linearly okay so this is TCP Tahoe"
"10-26","17:07","if you are using TCP Renault then instead of going to one directly you"
"10-26","17:13","will go into six you will go to six drop it to six and then directly increase"
"10-26","17:19","linearly okay"
"10-26","17:30","okay so this will appear on the test this will appear on the test"
"10-26","17:37","um I will basically for example I I will give you uh a cwnd when congestion"
"10-26","17:45","happens camera loss happens and I will ask you what will you do if you are"
"10-26","17:51","using TCP to how what will you do if you are using TCP rhino"
"10-26","17:57","okay this is how we control the congestion um so if we summarize basically for t250"
"10-26","18:05","can just control we have three phases slow start congestion avoidance"
"10-26","18:13","and then if we have a congestion then we will do first recovery okay so"
"10-26","18:21","those are the three uh States for congestion control the slow start is"
"10-26","18:26","basically the exponential increase part so this is the"
"10-26","18:33","slow start this is the"
"10-26","18:40","congestion avoidance"
"10-26","18:46","so this is a the first"
"10-26","18:53","recovery"
"10-26","18:58","so these are the three phases so if we look at the TCP throughoutput"
"10-26","19:04","okay you look at the throughput um the TCP throughoutput is a function"
"10-26","19:10","of the window size and also the rtt right because during this rtt time we"
"10-26","19:19","are sending the window size by so data okay so then basically the TCP"
"10-26","19:27","throughput is a calc calculated by using uh something about window side divided"
"10-26","19:34","by the rtt right but because of this congestion control let's see okay let's"
"10-26","19:39","assume we firstly have a half a window size W okay half of a w okay"
"10-26","19:45","uh W is the window size mattered in bytes one loss occurs okay"
"10-26","19:52","we know we we will increase this until to W and then if we have loss we drop to"
"10-26","19:58","half of w then we increase again to W then we drop to half of w it's like that"
"10-26","20:04","okay of course this is just a very rough mirror okay it's not accurate"
"10-26","20:11","then if we look at this figure we know okay so the average of a window size is"
"10-26","20:18","back is actually this right the hourly average uh window size is"
"10-26","20:25","about um three quarters of w okay that means the throughput the"
"10-26","20:33","throughput for TCP is three quarter of w"
"10-26","20:40","divided by rtt okay so that's why you can say it's actually three quarters or"
"10-26","20:45","W over rtt okay that is how we calculate the throughput roughly or we estimate"
"10-26","20:51","the throughput okay and if you want to do a more"
"10-26","20:58","um accurate calculation there are actually some more"
"10-26","21:03","um accurate formula for to use okay so for example if we have 105 1500 bytes"
"10-26","21:11","segments um and rtt is 100 Ms then if we want to"
"10-26","21:17","reach a 10 Giga BPS throughput this requires 83"
"10-26","21:24","333 in flat segments okay and we can also calculate the throughput"
"10-26","21:32","in terms of a segment loss probability okay which means how many segments we"
"10-26","21:37","can we can afford losing Okay then if you use this formula to do the"
"10-26","21:42","calculation then to achieve a 10 Giga BPS throughput we need a loss rate of L"
"10-26","21:49","equal to 2 to 10 2 times 10 minus sorry 2 times 10 to uh"
"10-26","21:57","negative 10. okay this is actually a very small loss rate okay a very very"
"10-26","22:03","small loss rate that means if we want to reach a big a very good throughput we"
"10-26","22:08","really need velocity to be very small okay"
"10-26","22:14","um and because of this congestion control TCP has a very interesting feature called fairness TCP fairness so"
"10-26","22:21","what does this mean this means if we have t k uh K TCP sessions"
"10-26","22:30","sharing the simple connect link okay and the most important link has a"
"10-26","22:37","bandwidth of R then each session should have the average rate of r divided by K"
"10-26","22:45","okay so that means if we have two connections sharing a link then each connection will finally get uh"
"10-26","22:54","half over if we have 3 then each connection will finally got a third of"
"10-26","22:59","our of the bandwidth okay so you may think oh how can we achieve that how why do"
"10-26","23:06","how do we know right so why we have TCP Fair okay so now let's look at two"
"10-26","23:14","competing sessions okay um the horizontal one is connection one"
"10-26","23:19","throughput the the vertical one is the connection to throughput we have these"
"10-26","23:25","two connections sharing a link which has the bandwidth of r"
"10-26","23:32","okay we know we will do addictive increase and multiplicative decrease right so"
"10-26","23:39","let's see how it how how does this work so at the very beginning you can see"
"10-26","23:44","at this point"
"10-26","23:51","at this point as you can see the value for connection one"
"10-26","23:58","okay is much bigger than the value of connection two that means the throughput"
"10-26","24:04","for connection one is much bigger than the throughput of connection two okay"
"10-26","24:09","connection one is taking more of the bandwidth and gradually they will they"
"10-26","24:14","will have similar bandwidth how why let's see let's see why okay so this is"
"10-26","24:20","a at the very beginning and then they all increase so finally the increase to"
"10-26","24:26","this point okay at this point connection one now"
"10-26","24:31","has a throughput of this this bit okay"
"10-26","24:39","and then connection to throughput is become this"
"10-26","24:45","big okay you can see connection one is still bigger and then connection two right the"
"10-26","24:51","throughput for connection one is still bigger than connection two but now let's see if the if at this"
"10-26","24:59","point we have congestion okay then we will do much multiplicative"
"10-26","25:04","decrease that means both of them need to be cut to half okay so if we cut half"
"10-26","25:11","our connection why it's about this okay it's about this"
"10-26","25:18","if we cut to half our connection two okay half of connection two is about about this this value"
"10-26","25:29","okay or maybe below below this so it's"
"10-26","25:35","roughly it's at this point so then that means now okay now the note"
"10-26","25:41","the the and now the throughput they all come to here okay this point after that"
"10-26","25:48","we will do increase again a digital increase again right so increase again"
"10-26","25:53","okay so now they are increasing at the same time and 0.1 becomes becomes this"
"10-26","26:01","this big okay and then throughput two"
"10-26","26:09","thank you become this big"
"10-26","26:15","okay at this point throughput one to become this big so let's see if we come"
"10-26","26:22","to congestion again now we need to cut both to half again so then for"
"10-26","26:29","connection one half is like this about"
"10-26","26:35","I know it's getting messy but hopefully you are following me okay about this and"
"10-26","26:41","then half of connection two is about this"
"10-26","26:48","okay so now you can see then the node is come to is coming to uh"
"10-26","26:54","this point okay so if you continue if you continue then this node is getting"
"10-26","27:02","to um this dotted line closer and closer okay the starting line means the equal"
"10-26","27:09","bandwidth share right the if the the node is on this line then"
"10-26","27:15","that means the throughput for connection one two are basically the same okay basically"
"10-26","27:22","the same so you can say it is getting closer and closer"
"10-26","27:27","to sorry finally it will it will get very close to this uh uh to this line"
"10-26","27:36","okay so that's why we say uh finally these"
"10-26","27:41","two connections connection one two they will share the bandwidth okay they will"
"10-26","27:49","share the menu with this is called the TCP fairness okay"
"10-26","27:55","um so usually usually the multimedia apps"
"10-26","28:02","do not use TCP okay why because we know the multimedia"
"10-26","28:09","um apps um they want to use the reads or the"
"10-26","28:15","bandwidth as much as possible they don't want to be controlled okay so but TCP"
"10-26","28:20","has the congestion control that's something not good for them okay so they don't want the read throughout to buy"
"10-26","28:26","the congestion control um so"
"10-26","28:33","um for UDP we know UDP may know they can tolerate the packet loss those apps like radio"
"10-26","28:40","audience they can tolerate the packet loss they uh they want the data to be"
"10-26","28:46","sent out as fast as possible okay um and also the fairness actually can be"
"10-26","28:52","leverage by some applications if some applications they want to occupy"
"10-26","28:57","or they want to have more uh bandwidth okay what they can do is they can open"
"10-26","29:04","multiple parallel connections between two hosts okay then in this case uh"
"10-26","29:11","because of the TCP fairness that each session or each connection will get a"
"10-26","29:18","share of the bandwidth okay if this application owns a number of connections"
"10-26","29:24","then this application can get more bandwidth okay so basically the web"
"10-26","29:29","browser do this the web browser for example it may open multiple tabs okay"
"10-26","29:36","to establish connections between Two Hosts okay let's say if we have a link"
"10-26","29:42","root of r with nine existing connections Okay then if a new app asks for only one"
"10-26","29:51","TCP connection then now we have 10 connections right so each application"
"10-26","29:57","can get each connection can get uh one tenth of R okay but if this new"
"10-26","30:04","application is very greedy this may ask for 11 tcps"
"10-26","30:09","okay for 11 tcps then basically this new application we all got so each"
"10-26","30:16","connection firstly we know we'll get r divided by 9 plus 11. this is a"
"10-26","30:22","uh the number of connections is 20 right so then for this for each share this new"
"10-26","30:30","application will get 11 of them so this is about half hour"
"10-26","30:35","you can see the difference right if the new application asks for only one TCP it can get only one tenth of R but if it"
"10-26","30:43","asks for 11 tcps then it will get half hour okay so that's how the TCP fairness"
"10-26","30:49","can be leveraged by applications to get more bandwidth okay then that's all for"
"10-26","30:56","this chapter third"
"10-28","0:01","all right so in this chapter we will this chapter is very important okay of"
"10-28","0:09","the students who finish this class after some semester they came back to me"
"10-28","0:14","again asking say hey professor uh I'm interviewing for a networking job do you"
"10-28","0:23","have any idea what kind of questions they will ask or what is the most important part for"
"10-28","0:30","networking okay um usually I I would just say Okay"
"10-28","0:35","networking is very important okay so tcpi tcpip transport layer"
"10-28","0:42","um and network layer obviously are the most important two layers in networking"
"10-28","0:48","so be prepared for those kind of uh questions if you want to get such a"
"10-28","0:54","position so in this chapter let me firstly give you an overview we will"
"10-28","1:00","introduce the network layer in 4.01 and we will discuss the workshop circuit and"
"10-28","1:07","the datagram network now you don't know what they are but uh let me see datagram"
"10-28","1:12","networks means what we are using right now that the internet okay virtual"
"10-28","1:17","circuit was an old design okay but I will show you the difference between them and then we will look at the router"
"10-28","1:24","and see what is inside the router what is the structure for the router or the architecture for the router okay"
"10-28","1:30","uh after that we will talk about the Internet Protocol IP protocol is very"
"10-28","1:37","important you really want to know uh the format for the datagram the how the ipv4"
"10-28","1:43","addressing is used um and why we use IPv6 right now"
"10-28","1:49","um so all those kind of things and then um 4.5 is also very important the"
"10-28","1:57","routing algorithm very very important okay so we will mainly focus on a link"
"10-28","2:04","State algorithm we've also discussed the distance Vector but uh the decimal"
"10-28","2:10","factor I will only give you high level uh test questions I will not ask for you"
"10-28","2:15","to like um run the exam or do calculations on the test paper okay no"
"10-28","2:22","um but next date I may give you task questions okay in deep uh hierarchical ranking we will discuss"
"10-28","2:29","that also and then after that we will discuss the gravity in real internet"
"10-28","2:35","what kind of routing protocol do we use in Internet okay"
"10-28","2:40","um so for uh broadcast routing we may"
"10-28","2:48","yeah we will discuss a little bit about the spanning tree Etc okay so that is uh"
"10-28","2:55","all what we will have in this chapter all right so let's look at firstly the"
"10-28","3:00","network layer okay when I talk about this layer I need"
"10-28","3:05","to help you review what has happened in the previous layer Okay so"
"10-28","3:13","I have draw this figure again again they have application layer"
"10-28","3:19","transport layer"
"10-28","3:25","Network layer link layer and physically okay so for"
"10-28","3:32","application layer we know we will have a big message foreign"
"10-28","3:42","for this message we know when it comes down to the transporter layer usually we need to break it up to smaller segments"
"10-28","3:50","okay smaller pieces"
"10-28","3:56","okay and then we add header to that"
"10-28","4:03","for those headers we know they are transported layer headers if you cannot remember you can review the slides"
"10-28","4:11","so basically in transport layer headers we have the source port number and"
"10-28","4:17","destination port number do we have it address in transport layer header"
"10-28","4:22","we do not okay we do not have IP address in transportally header it's only about"
"10-28","4:29","um if you remember UDP it's actually a very very short"
"10-28","4:35","header okay version header it has only like the support that's New Port the"
"10-28","4:40","checksum ETC okay then when this segment comes down to a"
"10-28","4:46","lower layer okay this is called segment"
"10-28","4:53","okay when it comes down to lower layer you know we already have the transport"
"10-28","4:59","layer header now we need to add another header which is Network layer header okay the network clear header will"
"10-28","5:06","contain the source id address and destination IP address okay so this is"
"10-28","5:11","the process basically the transport segment"
"10-28","5:18","uh the network layer will transport will transport the segment from the sending"
"10-28","5:24","to the receiving host okay so then on the sending side at the center side what"
"10-28","5:30","we will do is we will need to encapsulate the segments into something called datagrams"
"10-28","5:43","you can see at the application layer record a message transport layer recorded segment then at the network"
"10-28","5:51","layer we call it a datagram okay then on the receiving side when the"
"10-28","5:56","receiver receives this datagram it will remove the network layer header and"
"10-28","6:03","deliver the segment to the upper layer which is the transport layer okay the"
"10-28","6:08","network layer protocol is in every host and every router okay the router"
"10-28","6:15","examines the header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it okay so"
"10-28","6:20","let's see you can see the application layer in transport layer only exists in the end"
"10-28","6:28","hose okay but the network layer exists in all"
"10-28","6:33","the hosts and all the routers okay all the routers so this is what will happen"
"10-28","6:39","comes in comes down up down up down down until"
"10-28","6:46","finally it reaches at the destination okay then this is a uh sent to the upper"
"10-28","6:53","layer okay delivered to the transport layer and then the application here at the receiver side and we mentioned the"
"10-28","7:01","two functionalities 2K functionalities are actually forwarding and routing okay so for"
"10-28","7:09","wording means we move the package from the router's input to the appropriate router's output and then the routing"
"10-28","7:17","basically means determining the route taken by the package from source to destination okay so there is analogy on"
"10-28","7:24","the right the routine is like the process of planning the trip from source"
"10-28","7:30","to definition okay so for example I would say oh one day I want to travel to"
"10-28","7:35","New York I'm thinking uh should I trans"
"10-28","7:41","should I go through Chicago or should I go through uh La okay so those are those"
"10-28","7:49","are different rounds okay when I do the planning I may choose a different route"
"10-28","7:55","so that is the wrong team part the forewarning is like the process of getting through single interchange okay"
"10-28","8:03","so for example if I finally decided to go through Chicago then at the Chicago"
"10-28","8:08","airport as I said okay uh I need to"
"10-28","8:14","um come down from the airplane and then go to the correct gate"
"10-28","8:21","to step onto the plane to New York again okay so basically I was forwarding from"
"10-28","8:30","one gate to another gate okay so that is the forwarding part it's different okay"
"10-28","8:38","um I think we also explained this figure before but I would like to give you a quick review"
"10-28","8:45","so here you can see there there is a network okay in this network we have a number of"
"10-28","8:52","routers and in each router in each router it has"
"10-28","8:57","two things it will need to firstly run a routing algorithm okay and then generate"
"10-28","9:05","something called the local forwarding table this local forwarding table will help"
"10-28","9:10","decide how to forward a packet okay you"
"10-28","9:15","can see each router every router they all need to run their own"
"10-28","9:21","routing algorithm and then generate their own local phone table okay so for"
"10-28","9:27","example for this router for this router if we have a local phone table like this"
"10-28","9:33","and we have the header value of these ones okay then now if we have a"
"10-28","9:41","packet coming which has a higher value of zero one one then we immediately know okay we want to forward these two"
"10-28","9:48","outputs link two okay so this is how the local foreign table works okay later we"
"10-28","9:55","will learn more about that but for now you only need to know um the basics"
"10-28","10:02","so the routing algorithm determines the end-to-end path through the network and the forwarding table determine the local"
"10-28","10:08","forwarding and this router and later when we talk about the routine algorithm"
"10-28","10:14","I will show you step by step how to generate the local"
"10-28","10:19","phone table by running the routing algorithm okay"
"10-28","10:25","so before we continue to talk about the um"
"10-28","10:31","the routine Etc last firstly step back and talk about"
"10-28","10:38","um the different types of networks okay so one way to do the network layer you"
"10-28","10:45","if you think about the transport layer we have two main functions or two mean protocols TCP and UDP so we know TCP"
"10-28","10:54","requires connection setup eodp doesn't require the connection setup so and also"
"10-28","11:01","TCP is reliable UDP is not reliable right um"
"10-28","11:06","so then for Network there are actually also two types of network one type need"
"10-28","11:12","the connection setup okay like the uh um like some Network architecture like"
"10-28","11:19","ATM okay um for those type of network before the"
"10-28","11:24","datagram flow the two and Halls need to firstly establish a virtual connection"
"10-28","11:31","okay the routers will also get involved in this virtual connection okay so this"
"10-28","11:37","is connection oriented another type is connectionless okay it's connection is"
"10-28","11:44","um actually our internet interesting our internet is actually connectionless"
"10-28","11:50","okay we do not really establish any connection between two hearts before the"
"10-28","11:56","datagrams floats okay but this kind of connection setup indeed exists in some"
"10-28","12:01","of the network architectures okay it's not very common though"
"10-28","12:09","um and then let's look at the network service model uh if you use recall what"
"10-28","12:15","we have learned in the transport layer uh we know there are some Services we"
"10-28","12:21","expect from the transport leader like uh reliability okay time"
"10-28","12:28","uh minimal bandwidth guarantee right so those kind of things security so those"
"10-28","12:33","are the service we expect from the transport layer but we may not have it"
"10-28","12:39","okay similarly there are some Services we expect from the network layer"
"10-28","12:45","okay for example if we are delivering only one individual datagram"
"10-28","12:51","then some of the example uh services are guaranteed delivery okay that is the"
"10-28","12:58","service we expect from the network layer or guarantee delivery with less than 40"
"10-28","13:04","m second delay okay that is the expectation of some example Services we may not have it we"
"10-28","13:13","may not have it in the real network but those are Services we expect okay if we are"
"10-28","13:20","delivering a flow of datagrams okay then some of the example services are in"
"10-28","13:28","order delivery okay if you are sending out ABCD you don't want to get a busy"
"10-28","13:33","Ada okay um and also we may want to guarantee the"
"10-28","13:39","minimum bandwidth to flow okay we may also want to restrict the"
"10-28","13:45","changes in inter-packet spacing okay so again those are the services that we we"
"10-28","13:51","may want from the network layer but we may not be able to have it them in the"
"10-28","13:56","network layer okay so now let's look at um"
"10-28","14:01","the service models that we we may have in the uh Network architectures okay so for"
"10-28","14:11","internet for internet the service model is best effort service okay"
"10-28","14:19","do we have guarantees on bandwidth no guarantees and loss no guarantee that"
"10-28","14:24","order no no guarantees on timing no okay uh and we also we do not have congestion"
"10-28","14:31","feedback okay the feedback is actually inferred why are the loss the timeout"
"10-28","14:38","delay Etc okay uh so this is for internal for other"
"10-28","14:44","network architectures like ATM CVR or vbr okay"
"10-28","14:50","um constant bit rate or variable bit rate those are the um not very commonly used architecture"
"10-28","14:57","or these are the previously used architecture okay for"
"10-28","15:02","those ones some of them guarantee the bandwidth some of them guarantee the loss or the no loss okay or order or"
"10-28","15:10","timing um some of that them do not guarantee okay but any any of those ones are not"
"10-28","15:18","our focus our focus is the internet although internet provides no guarantee"
"10-28","15:24","but it works very well okay then let's let's look at the virtual circuit so"
"10-28","15:29","virtual circuit is basically a connection oriented network service okay"
"10-28","15:35","so it's different from the datagram network datagram network is basically a"
"10-28","15:41","connection okay I think I mentioned this before uh similar to TCP and UDP the TCP we know"
"10-28","15:48","we have to establish a connection before um data exchange but for UDP we do not"
"10-28","15:54","need a connection established right um and interestingly that in networking"
"10-28","15:59","Workshop circuit is actually corresponding to um TCP similar to TCP because it"
"10-28","16:05","requires the connection service okay and the datagram network is similar to UDP"
"10-28","16:12","because it doesn't require any connection to be established okay"
"10-28","16:17","um again as I said in the current Internet what we are using actually is"
"10-28","16:22","the datagram network okay so firstly let's see what is a virtual"
"10-28","16:28","circuit um so water circuit behaves like a telephony network okay so we have a"
"10-28","16:36","source two definition path reserved for uh for the connection okay uh we need to"
"10-28","16:43","do a setup for each core before the data can flow okay and then each packet"
"10-28","16:49","carries some identifier because we call it VC identifier virtual circuit"
"10-28","16:54","identifier okay the packet does not carry any destination host address no"
"10-28","17:01","host address just visit identifying okay then on every router on the source to"
"10-28","17:07","destination path maintains a state for each passing connection okay and then"
"10-28","17:13","based on um the VC identifier and also uh the"
"10-28","17:19","link that this packet comes in then the router needs to make a decision on how"
"10-28","17:24","to forward this packet okay so basically VC consists of a third"
"10-28","17:31","person a path from source to destination we see numbers okay uh this is the"
"10-28","17:38","number for each link along the path okay and also the entries in the forwarding"
"10-28","17:45","tables in the router along the path okay so let's look at example and then you will understand uh what did this mean"
"10-28","17:51","okay um firstly you can see we have a source so we have destination and we have a"
"10-28","17:58","router the router has three interfaces one two three okay and now if we"
"10-28","18:05","um uh also you need to know for each round here the router maintains uh"
"10-28","18:11","forwarding table okay this is a forwarding table is not the same as the forwarding table uh in"
"10-28","18:18","this program Network actually before we learned for datagram Network we only need to look at the IP address the"
"10-28","18:25","destination IP address for the packet and then we know how to do the forwarding right but in in this case in"
"10-28","18:32","this VC virtual circuit Network the router the router's phone table is"
"10-28","18:39","more complex than the datagram network so you"
"10-28","18:44","can see um it contains the incoming interface in coming VC number and then we will have"
"10-28","18:51","outgoing interface and outgoing VC number okay so then for example when you have a"
"10-28","18:57","packet comes in packet comes in with from interface one okay and the incoming basic number is"
"10-28","19:06","12. then the router need to determine the outgoing interface it is through and the"
"10-28","19:12","outgoing basic number is 22 so it's like that um sometimes the packets may come from"
"10-28","19:19","the same interface but they have different basic numbers and then they may be forwarded to different interfaces"
"10-28","19:26","with different wasting numbers okay so it's like this so this will not appear on the test so"
"10-28","19:33","you don't need to remember this table how this work the reason I want to introduce washer circuit is is I just"
"10-28","19:40","want to tell you there are actually different types of network layers okay"
"10-28","19:46","um different protocols but the one type we are using is the datagram network"
"10-28","19:52","okay um as you can see before we see circuits"
"10-28","19:58","if we want to do data um the transmission Etc we need to firstly"
"10-28","20:04","establish a call okay initially initial call and then this one accepts the core"
"10-28","20:11","and then uh the this flow begins okay this is the process but if this is a"
"10-28","20:16","datagram network we do not need to do any call setup okay uh the routers"
"10-28","20:23","maintain no State about the end-to-end connections okay the routers simply need"
"10-28","20:29","to forward uh the package so you can see what has happened is uh the sender will"
"10-28","20:36","send the diagrams and the receiver will receive the datagrams so if we compare the virtual circuits"
"10-28","20:43","networks and datagram networks datagram networks um is more preferred"
"10-28","20:49","um one major reason is because this actually makes the router very simple"
"10-28","20:58","okay the router only need to do the forwarding we do not have a lot of our workload put on to the router but for"
"10-28","21:05","the VC Network the router has to maintain in some states okay so it is it"
"10-28","21:12","has more workload okay so now let's look at the diagram"
"10-28","21:17","forwarding table for this forwarding table um it is very simple as we mentioned before"
"10-28","21:24","each router needs to run the routing algorithm to generate such a local"
"10-28","21:30","forward table and in the local format table on the left side we have the destination address on the right side we"
"10-28","21:37","have the output link so basically we only need to check the destination address and then determine the output"
"10-28","21:43","link okay so it's like uh if you if we if for example for post office"
"10-28","21:50","post office will need to look to look at the address of The Ledger and then determine where to forward"
"10-28","21:57","okay so for example if we have a sacramental post office Chicago post office uh New York post office La post"
"10-28","22:05","office okay then we basically uh look at the latter if this letter is is going to"
"10-28","22:12","New York okay then we know the destination address is uh is New York"
"10-28","22:18","some City okay and then we can determine oh the up link"
"10-28","22:23","should be should be uh this one okay should be for the link from uh"
"10-28","22:29","Sacramento to Chicago okay so it's it's like that"
"10-28","22:34","um so you may ask why is a address range"
"10-28","22:41","it's not an individual address so here it listed the reason we have about 4"
"10-28","22:48","billion IP addresses because we know IP address is 32-bit right so basically we"
"10-28","22:55","have if this is ipv4 then we have 2 to 32"
"10-28","23:01","um IP addresses okay for this many IP addresses it would be really hard to"
"10-28","23:07","list all individual destination addresses okay it also requires the"
"10-28","23:13","router to have a very large memory okay so it's not visible that's why instead"
"10-28","23:20","of doing um the individual addresses we actually use our address range okay it's like uh"
"10-28","23:29","in again in post office in post service what we will see is not for this specific address is actually for uh for"
"10-28","23:37","example the entire New York State we have we need to for all the letters going to the New York State we need to"
"10-28","23:43","forward it to uh this link okay so it's like that"
"10-28","23:50","um so in reality what you will see the forward table is looks like this okay so"
"10-28","23:57","firstly you can say uh this is a 32-bit okay each"
"10-28","24:03","part is eight bits okay so we have four eight bits so in total"
"10-28","24:10","is 32 bits this is the IP address okay we can say oh if the address falls into"
"10-28","24:16","this range okay between this IP and this IP then we can forward it to link one link"
"10-28","24:24","zero okay so you if you look at this IP address you can say the first 20 bits"
"10-28","24:30","are all the same and then the remaining ones are different"
"10-28","24:36","okay so the mini ones are different um and then we only need to check uh"
"10-28","24:42","each individual address and see which category or which range does this uh address four into them to determine uh"
"10-28","24:50","the link interface okay opening um but there is a question the question is"
"10-28","24:57","what happens if the range or the ranges do not divide up so nicely so here in"
"10-28","25:04","this example we know the first 20 B's are exactly the same"
"10-28","25:10","and the remaining ones are not the same okay so then we only need to focus on"
"10-28","25:16","the remaining uh travel bits but what if sometimes we have the first 20 bits the"
"10-28","25:23","same sometimes we have the first 16 bits the same okay it's like in post service sometimes we say oh all the"
"10-28","25:31","um all the letters go to New York state has to be forwarded to zero"
"10-28","25:38","okay then we in this case we are using States to define the range but sometimes we say"
"10-28","25:45","all the letters going to um San Francisco"
"10-28","25:50","needs to be forwarded to one and in this case we know San Francisco is not a state it's actually a city"
"10-28","25:57","okay um so we may say similar things in our working okay then in this case how what"
"10-28","26:04","can we do okay uh in this case what we will do is we"
"10-28","26:09","follow a principle of longest prefix matching okay lucky prefix matching"
"10-28","26:16","means when looking for forwarding table entry for given destination address we"
"10-28","26:22","use the longest address prefix that matches the destination address"
"10-28","26:27","okay so it's like again in postal service if we say"
"10-28","26:34","um if we see all the letters going to California should be forwarded to zero all the"
"10-28","26:42","letters go into sacramental should be 40 to 1. okay if we have a letter going to"
"10-28","26:49","for example 16000 J Street"
"10-28","26:55","Sacramento which link should we forward to should"
"10-28","27:00","we fold this to 0 or 1 so actually this will be forwarded to"
"10-28","27:06","one why because"
"10-28","27:12","um Sacramento come you if you compare California and Sacramento apparently"
"10-28","27:18","Sacramento is a more accurate um address right more accurate so we can"
"10-28","27:24","here we can see California Sacramento so this one is more accurate"
"10-28","27:31","okay so that's why if we have a letter going to if you have a letter going to"
"10-28","27:38","um 6000 J Street Sacramento we will forward this letter to one instead of"
"10-28","27:45","zero okay uh so this is called the longest prefix matching we will match California"
"10-28","27:52","first okay if we match California it can be 40 to zero or one but then we continue to"
"10-28","27:58","match and then now we we can match sacramental then it will be forwarded to one"
"10-28","28:04","okay so this is something you need to keep in your mind uh if we look at an example"
"10-28","28:09","here in the table so for example it says okay"
"10-28","28:15","uh for the ad for the address range of this okay you can see the first"
"10-28","28:22","um 16 21 first 21 bits are the same and"
"10-28","28:27","for the remaining these are wild cards okay so you can for this piece it can be"
"10-28","28:33","zeros or ones it doesn't really matter as long as it matched this one the move forward is to zero"
"10-28","28:40","but if it matches this one okay the first this this many"
"10-28","28:46","beasts are all match and then this piece can be arbitrary it can be zero or ones"
"10-28","28:53","we don't care uh then it will be set to one okay similar things for the"
"10-28","28:58","remaining uh ones okay uh now let's look at an example this example"
"10-28","29:05","for this one can you take a look at the base and determine which interface"
"10-28","29:13","should move forward to these beads are all the same okay these beads are all the same and these beads"
"10-28","29:20","are also the same so you only need to compare these remaining ones"
"10-28","29:27","okay so zero zero zero one zero zero"
"10-28","29:33","zero one zero one one zero zero it's definitely"
"10-28","29:38","match this one it doesn't match this one"
"10-28","29:44","okay it doesn't match this one"
"10-28","29:50","so which interface do we forward the first packet"
"10-28","29:57","first one is zero okay so we need to forward this to zero"
"10-28","30:02","because it matches zero right uh how about the second one the second one can"
"10-28","30:08","you check again for the second one we have zero zero zero one"
"10-28","30:13","okay it matches zero zero zero one and then one zero zero zero"
"10-28","30:20","it doesn't match this part doesn't match zero but it matches this"
"10-28","30:26","one zero zero zero and it also matches number two actually one zero zero zero"
"10-28","30:35","okay it matches both link interface one and two"
"10-28","30:41","so which interface should be for the second"
"10-28","30:46","packet it matches both this one and this one"
"10-28","30:54","which one will you choose so the interface we need to choose is actually one okay"
"10-28","31:01","um the reason is because the longest prefix matching okay if we if and one"
"10-28","31:08","address matches two ranges both two ranges okay then we"
"10-28","31:13","will choose the one um matches better match is longer okay and keep this in mind we will use this"
"10-28","31:21","later uh when we discuss the sub networks okay so very important"
"10-28","31:28","so if we compare the datagram network and the virtual circuit Network"
"10-28","31:35","so uh the internet for internet data exchange among computers okay it is"
"10-28","31:40","providing the elastic service we do not have any requirements on timing okay"
"10-28","31:47","there are many different link types like different characteristics um"
"10-28","31:52","it's a very uh it's very hard to have a uniform service okay and also uh for the"
"10-28","32:00","most important thing for datagram network and VC Network is for different network we have smart and systems okay"
"10-28","32:07","but the internal the the routers are dumb okay"
"10-28","32:13","they do not need to be very complicated or very complex okay so simple inside"
"10-28","32:19","but complex at the edge uh VC circuit is uh different okay for basic circuits uh"
"10-28","32:28","it's like a human conversation we know we may have strict timing for example"
"10-28","32:33","one two-party talk both of the two parties need to be online okay this is"
"10-28","32:41","of course this can guarantee the service okay"
"10-28","32:46","uh but again the most important thing is um for water circuit Network okay the"
"10-28","32:54","end systems are done they don't need to be very smart they can just be like telephones okay but the"
"10-28","33:02","routers are very complex the inside of the network is very complex"
"10-28","33:09","the next thing we want to discuss is what is inside a router okay for the router we want to look at"
"10-28","33:17","the architecture uh basically we use the launcher every day basically the router has two main"
"10-28","33:24","functions we have to ask you this question again again the two functions one is routing another one is forwarding"
"10-28","33:31","okay so these two functions actually are implemented by different"
"10-28","33:38","um components in the router for example we need to have a routine processor to"
"10-28","33:44","run the login and then we need to have a switching fabric to do the forwarding"
"10-28","33:50","okay so the switching fabric is for forwarding the package from the input"
"10-28","33:56","pause to the outputs okay if we look at the input parts so here we"
"10-28","34:04","we basically take one of this and we zoom in to look at uh the inside of the"
"10-28","34:11","input Parts okay and this is the this is the launcher we have the switching Fabric and now uh you can look at the"
"10-28","34:19","import for the input"
"10-31","0:00","next thing we want to discuss is what is inside a router okay for the router we want to look at"
"10-31","0:08","the architecture basically we use the launcher every day basically the router has two main"
"10-31","0:14","functions we have to ask you this question again so these two functions actually are implemented by different"
"10-31","0:23","components in the router for example we need to have a routine processor to run"
"10-31","0:29","the login and then we need to have a switching fabric to do the forwarding"
"10-31","0:35","okay so the switching fabric is for forwarding the package from the input"
"10-31","0:42","post to the outputs okay if we look at the input parts so here we"
"10-31","0:49","we basically take one of this and we zoom in to look at uh the inside of the"
"10-31","0:56","input Parts okay and this is the this is the launcher we have the switching Fabric and now uh you can look at the"
"10-31","1:04","import for the input Port firstly this one is the line termination this is the"
"10-31","1:11","physical layer okay in this layer um we will receive the beat level we"
"10-31","1:18","will receive the basically the binary the base okay and then uh we will come"
"10-31","1:25","to the link layer protocol so basically for example we have ethernet implemented"
"10-31","1:31","in this layer and then um we will come to"
"10-31","1:37","um the network layer okay in this layer we will do uh the forward table lookup"
"10-31","1:43","for example we will say oh for this destination address it should be forwarded to a certain output link okay"
"10-31","1:51","and we will also do queuing here do you remember the QE we said in the router the input Port the"
"10-31","1:58","router may have some buffers to carry the packets right so if the buffer is"
"10-31","2:03","full we may have a package drop right so this this is the one of the buffers okay"
"10-31","2:11","so basically um those packets will be cured here"
"10-31","2:17","um and then this package will be sent to the switching fabric for forwarding okay"
"10-31","2:24","so there are many different types of switching fabric for example memory type"
"10-31","2:32","bus type and crossbar type okay so the first switching fabric basically will"
"10-31","2:38","transfer the package from input buffer to appropriate output buffer"
"10-31","2:44","um and there is a read to measure the speed of the switching fabric it's"
"10-31","2:49","called switching Ridge so this is the rich at which packets can be transferred from the inputs to the"
"10-31","2:56","output okay so this is often mirrored as multiple of"
"10-31","3:03","input output line rate so for example each one has a line rate and then if we"
"10-31","3:09","have three that's three times this okay so it's measured in that way um"
"10-31","3:15","ideally ideally we hope the switching rich is the number of inputs times the"
"10-31","3:23","line rate okay so for the three types of switching fabric let's look at each one the first"
"10-31","3:29","type is called memory type okay and memory type you can see it goes through"
"10-31","3:35","a memory okay so generally this is the input port"
"10-31","3:41","okay the input port then a packet needs to be forwarded to"
"10-31","3:46","the memory first okay and then the memory will deal with"
"10-31","3:53","that we'll do some calculations or forward uh lookup and then forward it to"
"10-31","3:58","the output Port okay um this is actually"
"10-31","4:04","um this is a this type of router is very limited in terms of speed"
"10-31","4:10","Okay the reason is because the speed is limited by the memory bandwidth because"
"10-31","4:16","as you can see it has to go into the memory and then come out the memory okay"
"10-31","4:21","so that's why the memory is bandwidth is very important to this type of Roger uh"
"10-31","4:28","this kind is called first generation routers it's usually very slow okay"
"10-31","4:35","so the second type of routers uh using a bus as the switching fabric"
"10-31","4:42","um bus basically means um the data will come out from one port and"
"10-31","4:52","go through the bus to the output directly okay but there is a problem because if"
"10-31","5:01","in memory we can still for example hold multiple packets in the memory and then"
"10-31","5:06","send it out okay but in bus you can see there is no memory kind of thing to or"
"10-31","5:13","buffer kind of thing to hold those packets okay so then plus is uh is used"
"10-31","5:19","to directly connect the input port to the output then the problem is we may have best"
"10-31","5:26","contention okay bus contention basically means um for example if two even input Parts"
"10-31","5:34","they both among two forward package to some Outpost okay then they have to"
"10-31","5:40","compete for this band for this bus okay um so then in this case the switching Fab"
"10-31","5:48","switching speed is actually limited by the bus benefits okay"
"10-31","5:54","uh this is my second type um then gradually people began to design"
"10-31","6:00","people began to think oh if one bus is a me generate the bus contention problem"
"10-31","6:07","how about we create a uh interconnected bus okay or we could create something"
"10-31","6:14","called a crossbar okay as you can see in the figure here this is also called banging at work or"
"10-31","6:21","crossbar or some or sometimes we call them International interconnection Nets"
"10-31","6:28","okay so then basically in this case Okay in this case we have input pause output"
"10-31","6:35","pause okay but they are connected in this uh interconnected way okay then if"
"10-31","6:42","we have a datagram okay so that if we have for"
"10-31","6:47","datagram from multiple parts from multiple Parts okay so then they"
"10-31","6:53","can or they can be forwarded to the output without interving each other"
"10-31","6:58","okay because there are multiple routes to choose from okay and even more"
"10-31","7:04","interesting or more advanced design is that if we have one big datagram okay in"
"10-31","7:11","order to make the speed faster we can actually break this uh uh big datagram"
"10-31","7:18","into smaller pieces we call this as fragmentation or fragmenting okay and"
"10-31","7:24","then um send those smaller pieces in parallel to"
"10-31","7:29","the outputs okay and this can make the speed even faster that is the most advanced version okay"
"10-31","7:38","uh and then now let's look let's look at the um Outpost"
"10-31","7:44","so for option Parts um you can see it is actually the"
"10-31","7:49","opposite uh this this is the three boxes are ordered in opposite uh order as the"
"10-31","7:56","input policy input Port we know we have the green box which is physical here and"
"10-31","8:02","then we have the link layer then we have the uh Network layer okay this is the input"
"10-31","8:10","parts then we go to switching fabric then for the outer parts you can see its firstly"
"10-31","8:16","firstly data comes from the network layer and here we also have a buffer"
"10-31","8:22","okay and then we have a link layer okay"
"10-31","8:27","then it becomes zeros and ones to be sent out so this is the output okay"
"10-31","8:35","um the buffering is also required within datagrams arrived from the fabric faster"
"10-31","8:41","than the transmission rate we know it takes time to push the data out"
"10-31","8:46","okay um then if the incoming speed is very fast then we have to buffer the data"
"10-31","8:52","here in the output Port buffer okay"
"10-31","8:57","so and very interestingly here we need to have some kind of scheduling"
"10-31","9:04","um to choose among the cute diagrams for transmission okay because there are so"
"10-31","9:10","many um this grants killed here which one should we send out first"
"10-31","9:18","okay so there are different ways for the scheduling we will look at that uh later"
"10-31","9:24","okay so first let's look at the output Port queuing okay so you can say uh this"
"10-31","9:32","is the structure of the entire round term and this is the switching fabric the left part are the um the input post"
"10-31","9:40","right right part of the output because okay"
"10-31","9:45","um so you can see when these two arrives they all want to be forwarded to the to"
"10-31","9:52","this one and as you can see um as you can see this one can be forwarded"
"10-31","10:00","to here okay and this blue one can be forwarded"
"10-31","10:05","to here okay then we this one"
"10-31","10:11","will need to be forwarded to here okay then these ones are all cute here"
"10-31","10:18","so that later we can see this one and the red one will also be put into the"
"10-31","10:25","input parts waiting to be forwarded to the output box okay so this is a"
"10-31","10:32","um you can see the queuing okay those are cute here"
"10-31","10:38","um so you may ask how much buffer do we need for the output"
"10-31","10:43","okay so the rule rule of thumb is that the average buffer is equal to the"
"10-31","10:51","typical rtt times the link capacity okay this is uh roughly how you can"
"10-31","10:58","calculate the size of the buffer for example if you have a"
"10-31","11:04","10 Giga BPS link okay and we know the rtt is 250 M second"
"10-31","11:12","in this case we assume it's 250 M seconds then the buffer size need to be"
"10-31","11:19","2.5 gigabits okay so that is the buffer uh"
"10-31","11:26","of course if you want to do a more accurate calculation the recent"
"10-31","11:32","recommendation is if we have NFL then the buffer should be equal to this one okay this is a"
"10-31","11:40","calculated this can be used to calculate the buffer okay so this is I think this"
"10-31","11:46","is provided um like uh Federal experience experiments"
"10-31","11:53","okay and there are uh another another concept"
"10-31","11:59","you need to know here is called the head of line blocking"
"10-31","12:04","head of line blocking is like for example when you are driving okay when"
"10-31","12:09","you are driving um if you just want to turn right okay"
"10-31","12:15","but someone before you is trying to go straight"
"10-31","12:20","okay and even if you can turn right but because the the the car before you is"
"10-31","12:27","waiting for the green light so you cannot turn right you have to wait until the car before you left"
"10-31","12:33","okay uh that's what it's called the head of line blocking it's the same thing for example here we have this one and this"
"10-31","12:41","one they all want to be forwarded to this output okay"
"10-31","12:46","then we know um let me know the priority is given to"
"10-31","12:53","this one okay came into this red this one will have to wait okay this one doesn't need"
"10-31","13:00","to wait the blue one can directly go to here okay uh because this red one is"
"10-31","13:06","waiting to be sent to this output Port then the green one is actually blocked"
"10-31","13:12","there okay so this is the head of line blocking"
"10-31","13:18","all right um so as we said because all those"
"10-31","13:23","packets are buffered there in the queue in output"
"10-31","13:29","like this okay so then we have to have some kind of a schedule scheduling"
"10-31","13:35","algorithm to choose the next package to send on the link okay uh very simple way"
"10-31","13:41","is we do first in first out first thing first out basically means the packets"
"10-31","13:47","are running first will be sent out first okay it's very easy um so and we also need to think about"
"10-31","13:55","the discard policy because sometimes the package may arrive at a four Q then in"
"10-31","14:00","this case who to discard okay there are three different ways"
"10-31","14:05","about discarding so one way is okay we just do teardrop teardrop means we drop"
"10-31","14:12","the a driving package the new coming one okay second type is called priority drop that"
"10-31","14:18","means we can drop or remove uh based on the priority we can drop some low"
"10-31","14:24","priority One For example even if this packet is already killed there but this is not very important then we can drop"
"10-31","14:31","it and then um to to give some space to the new new"
"10-31","14:37","coming packets okay and we can do also random job okay so"
"10-31","14:43","those are three ways to discard a package um a second type of scheduling is called"
"10-31","14:50","priority scheduling this means we always we kept two we kept two queues one is"
"10-31","14:57","the high priority of Q another one is the low priority queue so when pack is arrives we need to uh assign them to"
"10-31","15:05","different cues based on them their priority and then we will always give"
"10-31","15:10","priority to the high priority queue okay so for example um if we have one coming in okay this is"
"10-31","15:18","high priority so we will do one first then we while we are working on one two"
"10-31","15:23","and three comes in okay then in this case three will be put into the higher"
"10-31","15:30","priority Q2 is put into the low priority queue so we will do three next and then"
"10-31","15:37","after three is down we do two okay if we have more Pocket Casts coming in let's"
"10-31","15:43","say four arrives when they are working on two okay then of course we will work"
"10-31","15:48","on four and when five lies then we work on five it's like that so we always give"
"10-31","15:54","priority to the high priority queue okay"
"10-31","16:00","but this actually creates a problem the problem is um is that we may have starvation for"
"10-31","16:08","the low priority queue okay uh so for example if we always have some some"
"10-31","16:15","packets in high priority queue then those packets will always be sent out first then the package in the low"
"10-31","16:22","priority Cube will never get the opportunity to be sent out okay so that"
"10-31","16:27","is the problem for this kind of priority scheduling then how can we address that problem"
"10-31","16:33","okay another kind of uh schedule is called"
"10-31","16:39","the round robin scheduling one Robin basically means we have multiple classes okay but we can"
"10-31","16:45","cite cyclically scan all the class cues and at least give the opportunity to"
"10-31","16:52","every class okay so we send one complete package from each class"
"10-31","16:58","so for example um we here you can see we have one two"
"10-31","17:04","three of Rhymes okay we do one first then we give opportunity to the next class although we have both two and"
"10-31","17:10","three but we have already Works worked on the red class so that's why we will work on the green class"
"10-31","17:17","then we do red Class 2 okay because we have no green now then we will do four"
"10-31","17:25","directly which is a red class okay so if I were arrives then I'm going to do five it's like that so in this case it's like"
"10-31","17:31","taking turns for every class we take turns every time we just give opportunity to one of the package in uh"
"10-31","17:39","one class okay in this case we do not have a starvation problem but the the"
"10-31","17:44","thing is also we do not have any priority right we do not have priority"
"10-31","17:50","to the red Plus either so that is the problem then some of you"
"10-31","17:57","may think how can we give or how can we give priority to the red glass to the"
"10-31","18:05","high priority class but also give some opportunity a little bit opportunity to"
"10-31","18:10","the low priority class how can we do that so this is a very interesting thing"
"10-31","18:16","actually what we can do is called red weighted Fair queuing okay or it's"
"10-31","18:23","actually generalized around robbing so we can referral killing means"
"10-31","18:29","we we still class them to different classes and if one class is more has more"
"10-31","18:36","priority then we give it more weight okay if one class has a low priority"
"10-31","18:43","then we give it last week in this way okay we can always"
"10-31","18:48","give priority to the high priority queues but we also give opportunity to"
"10-31","18:53","the low priority queues okay so this one is like uh we have W1 W2 W3 for each"
"10-31","19:01","class okay and then if W1 is let's say uh 10 this is a five let's say it's two"
"10-31","19:09","then this means every time we we send out 10 packets from the red class then"
"10-31","19:14","we send we can do five packets at most for green class then do two packets and"
"10-31","19:21","also for the blue class so that is the uh scheduling problem we will continue"
"10-31","19:26","to discuss 4.4 the Internet Protocol Okay Internet Protocol is a very"
"10-31","19:32","important part uh in networking so I hope you pay attention to this part okay"
"10-31","19:41","um personally let's look at the layers again we learned application layer"
"10-31","19:46","transport layer Network learning clear physical layer Etc okay so what we are"
"10-31","19:51","discussing now is actually the network layer so in network layer there are different protocols okay uh firstly we"
"10-31","20:00","know IP protocol okay IP protocol basically uh deals with"
"10-31","20:06","the addressing conventions the datagram format the packet handling conventions"
"10-31","20:12","Etc and then we also have the routine protocols the routing Protocols are"
"10-31","20:18","basically defining the routing algorithms right and not just the"
"10-31","20:23","logarithm actually how we for example select a path okay how we combine"
"10-31","20:29","different type of routing algorithms um when should we pay attention to the"
"10-31","20:36","performance of the Volcan algorithm where should we pay attention to the policy issues ETC so those things are"
"10-31","20:41","all defined in the routing protocols and then we also have the"
"10-31","20:47","um forwarding table forward symbol is actually generated by running the working algorithm"
"10-31","20:53","for icmp protocol this is uh mainly for"
"10-31","20:58","error reporting and router signaling so it's more like control okay control about the"
"10-31","21:05","um networking okay so let's firstly look at the IP data format"
"10-31","21:12","um we have learned we have learned the different formats like how uh the application layer message right and then"
"10-31","21:20","we learned the transport layer segment format okay do you remember if we are"
"10-31","21:25","using TCP then um the header is about more than 20"
"10-31","21:31","bytes okay the and then it has the payload so in the header we know it has"
"10-31","21:36","the source port number destination port number okay so let's maybe quickly read"
"10-31","21:42","this again we have several layers"
"10-31","21:48","application layer transport layer Network layer okay so at"
"10-31","21:56","application here we have a message and then we know when it comes to transport layer we need to add the transport layer"
"10-31","22:04","header into this message right to this message and in the transport layer header we know it has the"
"10-31","22:11","port numbers okay Source Point number that's the import number and then when this comes to a layer below"
"10-31","22:20","the network layer we need to have not so this is called a segment right"
"10-31","22:27","this is a segment then when we add a header to the segment we need to add Network layer header so then this"
"10-31","22:34","segment now is called the data graph okay this is this thing at the network layer is called Data graph and for this"
"10-31","22:41","datagram okay for this tablegram basically"
"10-31","22:48","um this is a header okay this is a actually this part"
"10-31","22:53","okay and then the payload as you can see"
"10-31","22:58","is this part okay so the payload is actually the TCP"
"10-31","23:04","or UDP segment pay attention to this okay it contains"
"10-31","23:10","not only the message itself okay it also contains the header for the transport"
"10-31","23:15","layer no matter is TCP or UDP okay so uh that's the payload and then let's now"
"10-31","23:22","look at the Hydra part the network clear header what do we have okay firstly we have the warrior number which number"
"10-31","23:29","here means ipv version 4 or version six uh later we will learn the difference"
"10-31","23:34","between the two versions okay and then we have header lens"
"10-31","23:39","header lens basically means the the number of bytes in the header okay so"
"10-31","23:47","the number of bytes in the header may vary because of the option part okay sometimes we may have uh options"
"10-31","23:55","sometimes we may not okay so that's why the header length may vary and then this is the type of service"
"10-31","24:02","which means what type of data it is then this is uh um a time to leave time claim"
"10-31","24:08","I think you are very familiar already right we said this is TTL"
"10-31","24:14","okay time to link TTL and TTL is very important this means the maximum number"
"10-31","24:20","of remaining hops if TTL equals to 2 this means the packet can travel at most"
"10-31","24:27","two more steps two more hops okay one hop is a a router right so then this"
"10-31","24:35","number will be decreed decreased at each router okay so"
"10-31","24:42","decremented at each router so for example if TTL equal to 2 when it comes"
"10-31","24:47","to a router then we will do -1 okay so here becomes one and then when it comes"
"10-31","24:53","to another router we'll do here minus one again so one minus one equal to zero we know at this time we have to drop"
"10-31","24:59","this packet okay and then um this field is the upper layer"
"10-31","25:06","protocol arpelier protocol basically means um"
"10-31","25:11","uh is this TCP or UDP so what are our player protocol okay"
"10-31","25:19","um and then this field is the length the total datagram length in bytes okay it's"
"10-31","25:25","different from the header length because the header length is only about the header but this length is about the"
"10-31","25:31","entire datagram after that we will say the 16-bit identifier the flags the and the"
"10-31","25:39","fragment offset these three fields are used for fragmentation and resembling"
"10-31","25:45","you don't need to understand it now later we will describe how we can use"
"10-31","25:50","these three bits for a through field for fragmentation"
"10-31","25:56","then you can see we also have um the header checksum okay and then we"
"10-31","26:03","also have the source and decision IP addresses okay and for source and"
"10-31","26:08","decision IP addresses now because we are using ipv4 with the source ID and"
"10-31","26:14","destination IP are all 32 bits they are both 32 bits okay and"
"10-31","26:21","pay attention again as we said okay we will use the 32-bit Source IP and"
"10-31","26:28","Destiny ip2 especially the destination IP to do the robot key okay to find out"
"10-31","26:35","the host okay the host uh which package we should deliver which host we should"
"10-31","26:40","deliver this package to okay so that is the function of IP address but uh if we want to find out a"
"10-31","26:49","specific process in the host then we have to look at the transport layer"
"10-31","26:55","header which is actually within the data okay which is actually within data"
"10-31","27:01","so that is how it works um and then in the auction part we may"
"10-31","27:06","have some more information like the timestamp um the record route taken and we may"
"10-31","27:12","also uh we may also specify the list of routers to visit okay so one thing you"
"10-31","27:19","need to know is we want to calculate how many bytes do we have in the header"
"10-31","27:26","if you look at again each row is 32 bits"
"10-31","27:31","each row is 32 bits okay 32 bits is four bytes right so eight uh B is probably so"
"10-31","27:37","four bytes and then we have five rows four times five equals to uh 20 bytes"
"10-31","27:43","right so it's 20 bytes of IP and you can see uh I didn't come to the"
"10-31","27:49","option part of course you can count the option part right if we count options then we know it's a 20 plus 20 plus"
"10-31","27:57","bytes for IP header for Network layer header and we know for T if we are using"
"10-31","28:03","TCP okay TCP has 20 bytes of a header okay so then in total you can see"
"10-31","28:10","um the header overhead the header overhead is 20 plus 20 uh equal to 40"
"10-31","28:16","bytes okay 40 bytes or even more than 40 bytes so that is uh the overhead any questions"
"10-31","28:23","so far okay"
"10-31","28:30","so the next thing I want to talk about is the IP fragmentation part"
"10-31","28:35","um so why do we do fragmentation firstly"
"10-31","28:40","the network links have MTU MTU is is the full name is called"
"10-31","28:46","maximum transfer size which is the largest possible link level frame"
"10-31","28:53","for different networks they have different network links they have different mtus"
"10-31","28:59","so for example you can think about uh for fiber we may have one mtu4 Wi-Fi we"
"10-31","29:07","may have different MTU so different links have different capacities and and"
"10-31","29:12","the capabilities that's why they have different mtus"
"10-31","29:17","um it's like it's like um when we drive on the road we may have a very wide Road"
"10-31","29:25","or very wide road that can accommodate maybe big cars trucks okay and we may"
"10-31","29:33","also have very narrow roads that can only accommodate very small cars"
"10-31","29:39","okay so it's like that similarly for Network links they have"
"10-31","29:44","different mtus then in this case we may have a very large IEP datagram"
"10-31","29:50","arriving at a link but this the size of this datagram already"
"10-31","29:58","exceeds the maximum transfer size of this link in this case what can we do we"
"10-31","30:05","have to divide the large IP datagram into smaller pieces for this we call it"
"10-31","30:11","as fragmentation okay that means one datagram becomes several"
"10-31","30:17","datagram several smaller datagram is like that we have one big datagram"
"10-31","30:22","and we break it into several smaller pieces this is called fragmentation"
"10-31","30:28","then these pieces May travel on their own finally when they arrive at the"
"10-31","30:35","destination we need to do assembly with us reassemble sorry we need to do"
"10-31","30:41","reassemble reassembling okay we need to reassemble those smaller pieces into one"
"10-31","30:48","big this graph one largest ground okay so then you can see the IP headers"
"10-31","30:55","are used to identify and order the related fragments"
"10-31","31:01","and we learned before here we said these three fails the 16-bit"
"10-31","31:07","identifier the flags and also the fragmentation fragment offset these"
"10-31","31:13","third fails will be used for fragmentation Now Let's do let's see how we can do a"
"10-31","31:20","fragmentation okay this is an example in this example we have a package the packet length is"
"10-31","31:28","400. so now what you are looking at is actually a datagram"
"10-31","31:35","okay this is the datagram the datagram has different fields do you remember lens right identifier"
"10-31","31:44","Flags offset so we also have this Here length identifier Flex offset"
"10-31","31:53","okay so now we want to break or break this big datagram into smaller pieces"
"10-31","32:01","let's assume the original originally this package has a length of four"
"10-31","32:06","thousand but MTU the maximum transfer size is"
"10-31","32:12","only 15 00 bytes okay so that means"
"10-31","32:25","this is a 4 000 byte packet okay and now we know pay attention"
"10-31","32:34","pay special attention women need to break this okay that means we need to"
"10-31","32:40","break this 4 000 package into 1500 pieces okay but there is one thing you need to"
"10-31","32:47","pay attention the first 20 bytes"
"10-31","32:54","are for the header do we need to break the header when we break the big datagram into smaller"
"10-31","33:01","datagrams we do not break the header okay it's like for example when you when you drive"
"10-31","33:08","a big car a big truck you come to a very narrow road you"
"10-31","33:14","cannot pass so then you can bring in several smaller trucks"
"10-31","33:19","in this case you only need to load the stuff on the big truck onto the smaller"
"10-31","33:25","trucks do you need to also load the truck itself you do not okay you do not"
"10-31","33:31","load the truss truck itself um and then what we can do is okay the"
"10-31","33:39","header we do not break okay so the next we only need to break the"
"10-31","33:46","remaining 39 80 bytes"
"10-31","33:51","and you also need to pay attention when you break them into smaller pieces"
"10-31","33:57","for the small truck of smaller datagram it also has a header so although in"
"10-31","34:06","total the maximum transfer size is 1500 but it"
"10-31","34:12","also use 20 bytes for the header so the remaining"
"10-31","34:18","1480 bytes can be used for data okay so"
"10-31","34:23","that's why when you do the braking you can say okay I need to break this into 1"
"10-31","34:30","480. and another one for 18. how many do we have now so 2 9 16 right 2 9 60."
"10-31","34:40","so we still have one thousand 120"
"10-31","34:48","bytes remaining is this correct"
"10-31","34:53","okay so this is how we break it into smaller pieces then what we can do is we"
"10-31","34:59","put this one this into um datagram number one okay and then we can"
"10-31","35:07","also put it into"
"10-31","35:14","this gram number two okay and then this round number three will be put into this one"
"10-31","35:29","does this make sense so this is how you do the fragmentation you basically put the data into"
"10-31","35:37","different smaller datagrams and again pay attention each datagram has 20 bytes"
"10-31","35:43","for header in the test many students made a mistake at this point"
"10-31","35:49","okay so now let's fill in the"
"10-31","35:56","data or the the data for these fields in smaller datagrams so for the number one"
"10-31","36:03","this is for number one for number one datagram the total length you can see is"
"10-31","36:09","1500. okay the ID number"
"10-31","36:15","the ID number will inherit the same we will inherit the big"
"10-31","36:21","datagrams ID it's very easy so frag flag this is a very special bit"
"10-31","36:30","this Beast is used to note to indicate if this small datagram is the last"
"10-31","36:40","uh fragment fragment or not because we know one big datagram may be broken into"
"10-31","36:47","many smaller pieces and when the receiver receives these smaller pieces the receiver need to reassemble them but"
"10-31","36:55","how do the how does the receiver know which one which piece is the last piece"
"10-31","37:01","so that it can do the reassemble right so that and the basically one of the"
"10-31","37:09","fields that the receiver can look at is the frag flag so if this front flag"
"10-31","37:14","equals one this means this is not the last piece we have more fragments coming"
"10-31","37:20","in if it equal to zero this means this is already the last piece there are no"
"10-31","37:27","other um smaller pieces coming in so you can do"
"10-31","37:32","the reassemble now it's like that okay so"
"10-31","37:37","and the last one is the offset the last field is offset the offset basically"
"10-31","37:43","means the position of this uh"
"10-31","37:50","small datagram in the large datagram for example"
"10-31","37:56","we know here the first the number one the number one"
"10-31","38:01","piece actually starts from here okay and this is the very beginning of the data"
"10-31","38:08","so that's why the offset is zero and this one we know it starts at byte 1 480."
"10-31","38:18","okay so by 21480 uh is the position of"
"10-31","38:24","the second the number two datagram okay so then"
"10-31","38:30","1480"
"10-31","38:35","1480 divided by eight is 185"
"10-31","38:41","you may ask why do we divide it by eight um we use H as uh eight bytes eight"
"10-31","38:49","bytes as a unit okay eight bytes as you need to calculate the offset so that's"
"10-31","38:55","why it's so 1480 divided by eight and then this number"
"10-31","39:06","this position we know it is actually 1 480 plus 1 for"
"10-31","39:12","80. is 2 9 60. so 2960 divided by 8 it is a 370."
"10-31","39:23","okay so that's how we calculated offset and you can see for diagram number two"
"10-31","39:30","and number three for number two the length is 1500 again"
"10-31","39:35","the ID is of also X the front flag is still one because this"
"10-31","39:41","is not the last piece and the offset we just mentioned how to calculate that the length for number three is very"
"10-31","39:47","interesting the net for number three is a you need to pay attention again this is"
"10-31","39:53","a length of the entire packet so it should include both the header and the data so"
"10-31","40:00","it's 20 plus 1020 equals to 1040. many"
"10-31","40:05","students made a mistake here in the test some of them forgot to add the 20 bytes"
"10-31","40:12","of a header okay they put 1020 here and"
"10-31","40:18","ID is also X frag flag is zero this means it is the"
"10-31","40:25","last fragment so you can do uh reassemble once you receive this one"
"10-31","40:31","um and then this is uh the entire example any questions"
"10-31","40:36","some of you are asking why do we need the offset to be divided by eight right"
"10-31","40:42","so the reason is because the offs the for the offset this field of the field"
"10-31","40:51","has 13 beats that means you can have at most 2 to 13"
"10-31","40:58","units or this number can be at most 2 to 13. okay"
"10-31","41:04","but the datagram itself can be much bigger than that okay much bigger than"
"10-31","41:10","that the date the diagram itself is a the total length can be"
"10-31","41:19","65"
"10-31","41:24","1536 that is actually equaling into uh this is this actually equals to"
"10-31","41:32","8192 this is 81.92 Plus 8. okay so if"
"10-31","41:38","you say okay if we want to we I want to denote every every byte"
"10-31","41:45","then we have this this offset number has to be this big okay if we want to denote every byte the"
"10-31","41:53","Precision the relative position from 0 to 66 65 536 this this offset number has to be"
"10-31","42:01","that big but apparently the offset number can be only 13 bit it can be at"
"10-31","42:07","most this big so that's why we cannot denote every bite we can only denote every eight"
"10-31","42:16","bytes okay we denote every it by so this is eight eight"
"10-31","42:22","so we divide this entire diagram into eight bytes per unit and then we can say okay this"
"10-31","42:30","is a zero this is a one this is two this is three it's like that so in total you"
"10-31","42:38","can have this number is one probably 8191"
"10-31","42:45","and then in total we have this many units each unit is advice then we can"
"10-31","42:53","denote the entire lithograph this makes sense to you"
"10-31","42:58","okay so that's why I mean you do not need to understand the details of this"
"10-31","43:04","okay you don't need to do this no need you don't need to know this you only"
"10-31","43:09","need to know the units of data is 8 byte in the"
"10-31","43:14","fragment in the fragment so that's why when we calculate the offset we need the"
"10-31","43:19","byte number the position of the byte number to be divided by eight okay that's"
"10-31","43:27","that's all you don't need to know that much details okay so then now let's look at this question for this question the"
"10-31","43:35","length and total length is uh one thousand"
"10-31","43:41","okay and among this 1000 we know the header is 20. so the remaining"
"10-31","43:48","980 of the data and when we do the fragmentation we know we only need to"
"10-31","43:55","divide the data for the for the fragmentation number one we know we we"
"10-31","44:00","need to divide this into the total is 40"
"10-31","44:06","420 420 so 20 bytes over"
"10-31","44:11","header and 400 bytes of data so 400 bytes of data okay and then we for the"
"10-31","44:18","number two is the same so 20 header"
"10-31","44:23","400 bytes of data again 400 so how many is left one thousand minus 800 200 200"
"10-31","44:32","minus twenty we have one 180 left so the number three will pack it will look like"
"10-31","44:39","this 20 bytes or header and 180 bytes of"
"10-31","44:44","data so this is in total 42 400 420 this"
"10-31","44:49","is a 200 so those are the lens those are how we calculate the lens so then for"
"10-31","44:55","number one we know okay the length is a"
"10-31","45:02","420 ID equal to X okay"
"10-31","45:07","frag flag we know this is not the last one so this"
"10-31","45:14","should be one offset is easy through the beer"
"10-31","45:19","this is at zero right so pi to zero we do not Hydra we only count the data so"
"10-31","45:25","the relative position for for number one is actually zero for number two we know"
"10-31","45:32","here it should be 400 for number three this relative"
"10-31","45:38","position from the start is a 0 to 800."
"10-31","45:43","okay so this is 800. that's how we calculate the offset we then we not use"
"10-31","45:49","this number to divide eight okay so then for then for packing number two we know"
"10-31","45:55","the length is also 420 ID is equals equal to X"
"10-31","46:03","frag flag equal to 1"
"10-31","46:09","offset equals to what 400 yes 400 divided by 8 equal to 50."
"10-31","46:19","okay for number three we know the length pay attention the length here you should"
"10-31","46:25","include the header not just 180 it's actually two hundred ID equals to X"
"10-31","46:32","flag flag equal to what it should be zero okay and offset equals"
"10-31","46:39","to 800 800 divided eight equal to 100 okay"
"10-31","46:44","so that's how you do the calculation all right so that is about the"
"10-31","46:50","fragmentation"
"11-02","0:01","the next thing we are going to discuss today is about the ipv4 addressing we we"
"11-02","0:08","know we all we are very familiar with IP address now right uh we know it's a 32-bit identifier we use it every day we"
"11-02","0:16","usually what we we talk about is this kind of thing right"
"11-02","0:22","223.1.2.0 something okay it's like that um but how why do we"
"11-02","0:29","um why why do we write IP address in this way okay uh how do we come up with this"
"11-02","0:36","kind of format so today we are going to introduce about the rationales the"
"11-02","0:42","principles for IP addressing okay so basically IP address we know is 32 bit"
"11-02","0:49","uh actually this IP address is assigned for each interface"
"11-02","0:55","for each host or launcher interface so what does this mean this means uh we"
"11-02","1:02","know on a host we may have the kneecard right network interface card"
"11-02","1:08","so this Nick card is a interface is the interface to connect to the network on"
"11-02","1:14","the routers we also have some interfaces so for example you can see for this router it has three interfaces so the IP"
"11-02","1:22","address is actually assigned to each interface okay uh sometimes for example"
"11-02","1:29","on your computer you may have the interface for wire Network and also for wireless network for those two different"
"11-02","1:36","networks you may have different IP addresses that is something you need to pay attention"
"11-02","1:42","um traditionally we already say oh my the the IP for my host is is a ABCD but"
"11-02","1:47","that is actually not accurate okay that is not accurate it's actually for the"
"11-02","1:53","host interface for specific host interface so then what is the interface interface"
"11-02","1:59","basically means the connection between the host and the physical link or the"
"11-02","2:05","router and the physical link okay it's the the con the interface used to"
"11-02","2:11","connect to the internet um usually the routers have multiple interfaces which means it has multiple"
"11-02","2:18","IP addresses okay um and the host typically has one or two"
"11-02","2:23","interfaces for as I said you may have wired or Wireless interfaces okay and the IP address is as"
"11-02","2:32","we said is 32 bit so 32 bits means"
"11-02","2:37","in binary it is 32 bits"
"11-02","2:42","okay and then we know it's very hard to remember this 32 bits in binary it's"
"11-02","2:50","very hard to remember then what is a better way to denote the 32 bits"
"11-02","2:56","um IP address so then people decide to divide the 32 bits into"
"11-02","3:04","four segments for each segment is uh H uh this is one byte basically okay so"
"11-02","3:11","then we can convert the binary into decimal so the number will be from 0 to"
"11-02","3:18","255. okay so for each byte the biggest number"
"11-02","3:24","is 255 then we can we can use dots to separate these four segments four parts"
"11-02","3:30","okay so that's why we can say for example the first bytes the first byte is now converted to 2"
"11-02","3:37","23rd and then the second byte is converted to one in decimal and this is"
"11-02","3:44","one in decimal this is one in decimal so that's why we have two 23.1.1.1 okay so uh in the future when"
"11-02","3:53","you see uh IP address in decimal you know you are able to convert it back to"
"11-02","3:59","Binary okay any questions"
"11-02","4:06","all right uh you may also ask how are interfaces actually connected how are"
"11-02","4:12","they connected for example here you may say oh we have uh this interface"
"11-02","4:20","this interface this one this one with the router we have this many interfaces"
"11-02","4:25","here right so how are those interface connected that will be something that we"
"11-02","4:32","will learn uh in the ethernet layer okay in another sorry I should say in the"
"11-02","4:39","link layer okay in the link layer we will talk about the switch we will talk about how to connect the adjacent"
"11-02","4:46","interfaces okay so that is something you don't need to worry about now"
"11-02","4:54","uh another Concept in networking a very important concept is subnet you heard"
"11-02","5:01","about this term again again okay so what is a subnetic basically"
"11-02","5:08","um for uh subnet we basically mean the device interfaces can be connected with"
"11-02","5:15","each other without intervening the router okay without intervening the router for"
"11-02","5:23","example here we have this these four interfaces these four interfaces can be"
"11-02","5:29","connected together without a router in between okay similarly for this interface you"
"11-02","5:36","can see they can be connected together without a router imbition so now we call this as a"
"11-02","5:45","subnet and this"
"11-02","5:51","as a subnet and this is another subnet okay so we have three"
"11-02","5:58","subnets now and at your home you may have your home network okay your home"
"11-02","6:04","network um is itself is of course a small Network right so you can also view that"
"11-02","6:10","as a small subnet because your devices can be connected together okay but this"
"11-02","6:19","your home network is is a little bit different from the subnets because uh"
"11-02","6:25","you may or may not use a switch to connect those interface scalar your"
"11-02","6:31","device is maybe connected to the browser directly okay so that is the difference"
"11-02","6:36","uh and some of you may ask them how can we know how can we denote how can we see"
"11-02","6:42","usually how can we see it belongs to a subnet or not those interfaces belong to one subnet or not okay so usually you"
"11-02","6:50","can tell from the IP address for example for the IP address usually we have two parts"
"11-02","6:55","the sub Network part and the hotspot so the sub Network part is used to denote"
"11-02","7:01","the subnet and the host part is used to denote the host the individual horse it's like the subnet part is like the"
"11-02","7:10","family name for us we all have our our own names for example my first name is"
"11-02","7:15","showian last name is San right so that the sun is like the same approach this"
"11-02","7:21","means um I belong to the same family okay and then my first name is the host parties"
"11-02","7:28","it's like the hospital it's used to uh denote myself okay to represent this"
"11-02","7:36","me okay this individual so that is the difference then usually if the sub"
"11-02","7:42","Network part the high order beats are the same then very likely they belong to"
"11-02","7:48","the uh same subnet so for example here you can say for this subnet okay the high order bits"
"11-02","7:56","are 223.1.1"
"11-02","8:01","then you can see the remaining this one two three four they are different okay"
"11-02","8:09","so then you can see they belong to the same subnet okay similarly for this one"
"11-02","8:15","for this one you can see the high order bits are 223.1.2 okay the host part is one two"
"11-02","8:26","nine okay so that means they are they very likely they belong to the same"
"11-02","8:31","subnet and similarly here you can say 223.1.3"
"11-02","8:36","okay to the third and then we have 2 27 one as the hotspot okay"
"11-02","8:44","um by looking at IP address you can you can"
"11-02","8:49","um estimate if they are in the same subnet but this"
"11-02","8:55","may not be accurate okay because sometimes you cannot determine"
"11-02","9:01","how many bits are used for the sub Network part okay so that's why usually the best way to do"
"11-02","9:08","it is to look at the topology of this network and see if the router is in is"
"11-02","9:16","is within the subnet or not okay if there is a router in between that means"
"11-02","9:22","this is not a subnet okay and now you can see"
"11-02","9:28","um this is the example we've explained and how do we denote a subnet okay we"
"11-02","9:33","can denote a subnet use some using something called mask okay for example"
"11-02","9:39","if we use the first 24 bits the first 24 bits"
"11-02","9:45","as the subnet part for the IP address then we what we"
"11-02","9:50","can do is write in this way"
"11-02","9:56","223.1.3.024 slash 24 means this is the subnet mask"
"11-02","10:02","okay that means we use the first 24 bits to use as the sub Network part it's like"
"11-02","10:10","I use the first 24 bits as the family name okay as the family name and then"
"11-02","10:16","the remaining eight bits are used to denote the individual house okay so that"
"11-02","10:22","is how we use the subnets now let's look at this example in this"
"11-02","10:30","example can you tell can you tell how many subnets we have think about the informal definition I"
"11-02","10:37","mentioned before I said for to divide the subnet we need to make"
"11-02","10:42","sure there is no rubber in kitchen okay"
"11-02","10:47","so for those of you who see third I'm guessing you are talking about this one"
"11-02","10:54","this one and this one right we are talking about the"
"11-02","11:00","interfaces so those interfaces are connected together without a router so"
"11-02","11:06","they can be three subnets but how about these ones"
"11-02","11:13","is this also interface yes is this also interface yes okay so are they connected"
"11-02","11:20","together yes is there a voucher in between no so this is also a subnet okay"
"11-02","11:27","similarly this is also a subnet and this is also a subnet"
"11-02","11:32","you may say there are no computers but we didn't mention we must have computers"
"11-02","11:37","in between right we just mentioned the interfaces okay the interfaces are"
"11-02","11:44","connected together without a router so that's why those three are also the"
"11-02","11:49","subnets so the correct answer is actually six so the next the next thing let's discuss"
"11-02","11:55","the IP address in depth okay so the IP addressing we have uh we have a"
"11-02","12:03","classless kind of Ip addressing okay so class list um the phone name is called Cider"
"11-02","12:09","classless enter the main routing okay"
"11-02","12:15","um so basically this means for the entire IP address we divide it into the"
"11-02","12:21","format of this a dot b dot C dot d slash X so we divide it into the subnet part"
"11-02","12:28","and also the host part okay so the subnet parts we can use the number X to"
"11-02","12:35","denote how many bits is used for subnets so for example here we use 23 bits 23"
"11-02","12:42","bits the first 23 You Can Count okay the first 23 bits are used as subnet and the"
"11-02","12:49","remaining nine bits are used for host okay and we do not have any requirements"
"11-02","12:55","on how many bits can be used for summer you can use two bits for subnet and use all"
"11-02","13:02","the remaining 30 pieces for host or you can use um 30 bits as a subnet and use only two"
"11-02","13:09","bits as a host so then what is the difference you can you can think about this for example"
"11-02","13:15","if we use a 30 23 bits as the sub Network part okay"
"11-02","13:22","then how many subnets can we have in total for the entire internet if we all divide it in this way then the total"
"11-02","13:30","number of thumbnails we can have is actually 2 to 23. we have we can have"
"11-02","13:35","this many subnet okay sub Networks but in each sub-network how many hosts"
"11-02","13:43","can we have we know in each subnetwork the number of"
"11-02","13:49","hosts is actually two two nine okay"
"11-02","13:54","then you can think about this if we use the first 30 bits and subnet okay then"
"11-02","14:01","the number uh subnet this is the number of a host"
"11-02","14:09","okay if we use 30 bits for subnet then"
"11-02","14:14","the number of subnets is a 2 to 30 and the number of hosts is two two"
"11-02","14:21","okay so that means what that means we can have so many subnets but each subnet is very"
"11-02","14:29","very small each subnet can only have four hosts one two three four they can"
"11-02","14:34","have only four hosts okay if we use for example two bits as the"
"11-02","14:40","subnets let me use three maybe have three piece as the Summoners okay"
"11-02","14:46","uh then the number of subnets will be two to three"
"11-02","14:51","that means we can have at most eight subnets but how many hosts can be accommodate in"
"11-02","14:57","each subnet each subnet we can have two two"
"11-02","15:04","nine we can have a 2 to 29 uh horse what"
"11-02","15:09","does this mean this means we can have only eight subnets but those a subnets"
"11-02","15:15","are huge okay because each one can accommodate a lot of horse"
"11-02","15:22","okay in the first situation when we have 30 bits as the sub Network part"
"11-02","15:28","we can have a lot of subnets but the each subnet is very small it can"
"11-02","15:36","accommodate only four costs okay so then you can see"
"11-02","15:42","by adjusting the number of subnets in IP address we can actually adjust the"
"11-02","15:52","size of the subnet and also the total number of subnets we can accommodate"
"11-02","15:57","okay so then this is very good because sometimes we need a big subnet okay if"
"11-02","16:04","we have a lot of machines to connect we need to speak subnet okay uh then in this case we can say we need"
"11-02","16:10","to assign more beats to The Host okay and the last piece to the subnet but"
"11-02","16:17","sometimes we may have only two machines through machine or a few machine to connect then in this case we can"
"11-02","16:24","um assign as few bits to the host okay and"
"11-02","16:29","uh more beats to the subnet okay so basically we can adjust the size uh very"
"11-02","16:36","flexibly um by using by adjusting the piece of the pc47s so"
"11-02","16:44","then if you do not have any questions let's look at the network classes we"
"11-02","16:50","said we just talked about uh the classless entered the miracle right this is classless but originally I mean the"
"11-02","16:59","network actually was classified into different classes okay for example"
"11-02","17:05","um here with me this here you can see this is Class A for class in a network"
"11-02","17:11","you can see the the white part are used for subnet the yellow beads are used for"
"11-02","17:18","the horse Okay so for class a network you can see the we use the cell eight"
"11-02","17:25","bits eight bits of four subnet and we use the the remaining 24 bits for the"
"11-02","17:31","host so that means what that means and also you need to pay attention for class A the first bit is zero"
"11-02","17:39","because uh b c d and e the first speed are all one okay I O one so that's why"
"11-02","17:46","uh the for class A the first bit is fixed okay it's fixed so then now you"
"11-02","17:53","can say for class a network how many Class A networks can we have"
"11-02","17:59","how many Class A networks can we have in total for the entire network"
"11-02","18:07","you you can check how many bits can we have we have well in total we have eight bits but the first bit we cannot change"
"11-02","18:14","right the first bit is zero so that's why in total is actually two to seven"
"11-02","18:20","right it's two to seven very close to uh yeah two to seven okay"
"11-02","18:28","um and then for the host part for the Post part how many hosts can we have in"
"11-02","18:33","each class a network you think about this we use 24 bits okay so it should be"
"11-02","18:43","2 to 24. we have two to twenty four hosts we can accommodate this many Hots"
"11-02","18:49","in class a network okay so this is for class A for class B"
"11-02","18:55","okay for class B we use similarly we use the first twin uh first"
"11-02","19:02","um 16 bits as the network part but the first two"
"11-02","19:08","bits are fixed okay it must be one zero so you can see this is actually we can"
"11-02","19:14","have two two fourteen subnets each subnet is again two two"
"11-02","19:24","16. okay 2 to 16 house we can have this many holes but in reality okay the"
"11-02","19:31","number of holes should be 2 to 18 minus two why because the host ID"
"11-02","19:38","0.0.0.0 and the ID 225.225"
"11-02","19:43","um is actually reserved for something else okay it's reserved for something else later we will talk about that for"
"11-02","19:50","example uh 225.25 is used for broadcasting okay so"
"11-02","19:56","um so for those for those we do not use them that's why the number of holes should be -2 okay then we can continue"
"11-02","20:03","for Class C for Class C this is basically for example first third piece"
"11-02","20:09","are fixed so then two to twenty four minus 3 is actually 21 it's for subnet"
"11-02","20:17","and two two eight is for house okay and then you can continue for class"
"11-02","20:24","D and E Etc so as you can see um regionally when people talk about"
"11-02","20:30","class A B C D E the major difference is actually their size okay when we say oh"
"11-02","20:35","this is the class a network that is that actually means this it doesn't work it's"
"11-02","20:41","very very big okay this subnet is very big if we see this is a Class B Network okay it's it's like oh okay the size is"
"11-02","20:49","it can accommodate at most about 65 000 Parts okay if it's a cluster Network we"
"11-02","20:57","know this is a small uh small Network okay so it's like that and pay attention pay attention uh for"
"11-02","21:05","this type of classification okay it may not work very well sometimes because for"
"11-02","21:12","example for classy Network we can accommodate 254 of 254 house"
"11-02","21:18","but for class B we can accommodate 65 000 more than 65 000 house"
"11-02","21:23","now what if we have a Network that has uh 1000 hosts should we make it classy"
"11-02","21:31","apparently not because Class C is not big enough should we make it Class B we can but we"
"11-02","21:39","can see there is a risk of IP address right so we use only a thousand IP addresses among this"
"11-02","21:46","entire um Network okay and the remaining IP addresses are listed so that's why this"
"11-02","21:54","kind of classification classification is actually not very good uh that's why we"
"11-02","21:59","prefer to have uh Sader now okay classless addressing okay"
"11-02","22:06","the next the next thing you may you may ask is how can we get one IP address how"
"11-02","22:12","can can host get the IP address okay there are two different ways one way is"
"11-02","22:18","you can actually uh hard code IP address in a file for example you for Windows"
"11-02","22:24","system you can go to appropriate files okay you can change the IP address for this machine or in Unix system or Linux"
"11-02","22:32","system you can also uh set up the IP address manually okay"
"11-02","22:38","basically when you for example in Windows system when you try to set up the IP address you also need to"
"11-02","22:44","specify the network mask the Gateway router Etc you need to specify a lot of"
"11-02","22:51","information okay and that method is not very flexible not very convenient the"
"11-02","22:58","reason is because when you assign IP address that IP address is occupied okay"
"11-02","23:04","but sometimes you don't not know which IP address is occupied you have to try"
"11-02","23:10","different IP addresses otherwise you may have conflict with other machines okay so I've done that before"
"11-02","23:18","many many years ago and I often write that problem that I am competing with"
"11-02","23:25","other machines for one IP address okay so that's why gradually now people are"
"11-02","23:31","using deep CP so DHCP is dynamic host configuration protocol this is one"
"11-02","23:38","protocol that can dynamically assign IP address to the servers or to the"
"11-02","23:44","machines sorry not to the servers from a server to the machines okay so basically"
"11-02","23:50","a DHCP server um wheel respond"
"11-02","23:56","and help to assign IP address to a machine okay this is a plug and play"
"11-02","24:03","protocol it's very easy to use very convenient there is no problem of conflicting IP address let's look at"
"11-02","24:11","this protocol so basically the goal for this protocol"
"11-02","24:17","is to allow the host to dynamically obtain the IP address from a server when"
"11-02","24:24","it joins the network and if and this IP address can be renewed"
"11-02","24:32","okay what does this mean this means because for example when you join a network you are assigned IP address and"
"11-02","24:39","this IP address can be valid for certain amount of time after this time expires then this IP"
"11-02","24:47","address cannot be used anymore but we in this case we can renew the list okay we"
"11-02","24:52","can renew the list on the address in use this also uh this DCP will also allow"
"11-02","24:59","allow the ReUse our address what does this mean this means if one machine left"
"11-02","25:05","the IP used by that machine can be reused by some other machines okay so"
"11-02","25:12","then this also supports the most buy users who want to join the network so"
"11-02","25:17","it's very convenient okay um basically this dtcp has uh the"
"11-02","25:24","digital discover offer request AC key Visa four different types of messages"
"11-02","25:29","let's look at an example here in this scenario we have one"
"11-02","25:35","digicip server okay and we have the subnet okay you can"
"11-02","25:41","see this subnet the first four 24 bits are used for to denote the subnets"
"11-02","25:47","and now we have a new client trying to join this network this new"
"11-02","25:54","client needs a IP address okay so what what what can the uh so"
"11-02","26:02","what will happen after that so basically the client will need to shout to"
"11-02","26:08","everybody okay say is there a d2cp server out"
"11-02","26:13","there why is this a broadcast message because the client does not know"
"11-02","26:21","who is the d2cp server okay so that's why the client has to shout to everybody"
"11-02","26:27","so how can the client Shout very easy okay the source address is"
"11-02","26:35","zero zero zero zero that's why we said before zero zero zero zero is actually reserved okay it's reserved this stock"
"11-02","26:42","address basically means I do not have an IP address yet okay I'm waiting for assigning IP address"
"11-02","26:49","and then the destination address is 255 255 255 255. this means this means"
"11-02","26:58","this message is for everyone for everyone okay"
"11-02","27:03","and here the source part is 68 and the destination Port is 67 that means the"
"11-02","27:10","d2cp server is actually listening to 67. and this is this uh uh Yi address is"
"11-02","27:20","actually this will be changed later okay this means I'm waiting for uh for uh"
"11-02","27:26","assignment okay uh and then last line is"
"11-02","27:31","the transaction ID Okay so then the everybody will receive this"
"11-02","27:36","message everybody will receive this message but for those machines who are not dtcp"
"11-02","27:44","servers they will simply discard the message they may not listen to 67 okay"
"11-02","27:49","they do not listen to 67. only DHCP server is listening to 67 and DHCP"
"11-02","27:55","server will respond to say hey I'm the DHCP server and here is an IP address"
"11-02","28:01","you can use okay how is this now basically the DHCP server now will"
"11-02","28:09","introduce itself my source address is this one and my port number is 67. the"
"11-02","28:15","destination address is now in your broadcasting it's still 255 a bunch of"
"11-02","28:21","255 why because the client does not have any IP address yet"
"11-02","28:27","the division server cannot reply to a specific IP address so that's why it also has two broadcast and the port"
"11-02","28:36","number is 68 because originally we learned the phone number"
"11-02","28:41","168 okay and this is the offered IP address okay so the DSP server say you"
"11-02","28:50","can use this IP address of 223.1.2.4 as your new IP address"
"11-02","28:55","the transaction ID is 654 the same as the last one means this"
"11-02","29:01","is the reply to last message and the lifetime is 3600 seconds what"
"11-02","29:06","does this mean this means the IP address is valid within 3 600 seconds"
"11-02","29:13","after that if you still want to use this IP address you need to renew okay"
"11-02","29:18","and then this client will reply say okay I'll take that IP address"
"11-02","29:24","okay and then in this case you can see"
"11-02","29:29","of the source is zero zero zero because there is no confirmation yet so and then"
"11-02","29:34","destination is still the same thing 255 to 55 okay broadcasting to everyone"
"11-02","29:40","and the IP address this one okay this is a confirmation"
"11-02","29:48","to the server say I'm I will take this IP address okay the transaction ID is uh 655 this"
"11-02","29:58","is like a request a request would say hey I'll take this IP address I'll take"
"11-02","30:04","this IP address okay and I know the lifetime is 3600 seconds"
"11-02","30:09","okay then the server will confirm again so okay"
"11-02","30:15","now you've got that IP address okay so now you have uh you can see the source"
"11-02","30:22","is this one and destination is still broadcasting and now it's a confirmation that this IP"
"11-02","30:28","address can be used by the client and then transaction ID is the same as the last request message lifetime is 36 100"
"11-02","30:36","seconds okay so this is the entire process you may feel like oh the second part seems"
"11-02","30:44","like very redundant right the second time seems redundant uh"
"11-02","30:51","why do we need to have a confirmation again again okay there is the reason here"
"11-02","30:57","because in the network we may have multiple thcp servers okay when the"
"11-02","31:04","client broadcast the message to everyone multiple industry scissors May reply"
"11-02","31:11","with multiple IP address candidates okay so then this client needs to choose"
"11-02","31:17","one specific address and then make the DHCP request say I'll take that one not the others"
"11-02","31:25","okay although I got several offers but I only choose one okay and then the server"
"11-02","31:30","will uh ack so that is the entire process okay and that's the reason why"
"11-02","31:36","we have the confirmations again in the second part this will happen once you"
"11-02","31:42","join a new network okay and sometimes the d2cp server is actually combined"
"11-02","31:47","together with a router the router can directly it also serves as a server okay"
"11-02","31:52","but sometimes dtcp server is separate so so when you connect to a network this"
"11-02","31:57","happens automatically the ddcp actually return information"
"11-02","32:04","a lot of information not just the IP address not just the one we see here you"
"11-02","32:09","can see the IP address of two two three one two uh four right uh actually it"
"11-02","32:16","also provides more information what information this information it will also provide the address or the"
"11-02","32:24","first hope launcher for the client so because we know when the client joins"
"11-02","32:30","this network the client is new right the client is new to this network the client"
"11-02","32:35","has no information about the network so that's why DHCP is very important to"
"11-02","32:41","introduce the basic information about that Network to the client so the clients know how to continue okay the"
"11-02","32:49","first very important thing is the first hop launcher why because when the client"
"11-02","32:54","wants to send something outside the network it needs to contact the first"
"11-02","32:59","Hub browser so that's why dtcp need to introduce the first Hub browser to the"
"11-02","33:04","client okay so this is the first piece very important and we are we actually we are going to"
"11-02","33:10","use this information again again um the second piece of information is"
"11-02","33:15","the name and IP address or DS server DNS server is also very important we"
"11-02","33:22","know the SD has a help help the client to interpret the"
"11-02","33:30","um the mean name address into some IP address okay so that's why it's also"
"11-02","33:36","very important without DNS the client can do nothing okay that's the second piece of"
"11-02","33:41","information the third piece of information is the network mask okay padding in the network Market will"
"11-02","33:50","help the client know which part is used"
"11-02","33:55","for the network which part is used for host so when it is connecting with some"
"11-02","34:01","machine okay some IP address it knows how to interpret this IP address okay so"
"11-02","34:07","that those are the three pieces of information that will be returned in"
"11-02","34:12","addition to IP address by the DHCP okay so this is very important"
"11-02","34:19","so you can say here we have a router with DCP server built into the router"
"11-02","34:26","okay so the the DHCP server is combined with the router"
"11-02","34:31","and we have a switch here and we have a computer here okay we have this computer"
"11-02","34:38","when this computer joins the network okay this client you can see we are"
"11-02","34:43","looking at the five layer now a five layer application layer transport layer"
"11-02","34:50","Network layer okay link layer and physical layer so I hope you have this"
"11-02","34:57","five layers in your mind forever okay do not forgot that and then now add the application layer"
"11-02","35:05","you can see we will form a DHCP request message okay for my DCP request message"
"11-02","35:12","and this message will be sent to the"
"11-02","35:19","um transportator and the transport layer will add a transported layer header here"
"11-02","35:27","okay the pay attention here the transport layer protocol we are using is"
"11-02","35:34","UDP not TCP why do we use"
"11-02","35:40","UDP instead of using TCP we're doing is it is about reliability"
"11-02","35:47","actually no this is not about reliability okay we all know that for"
"11-02","35:54","TCP protocol we need to establish a connection before we do that Exchange but pay"
"11-02","36:01","attention this machine does not know who is the server yet"
"11-02","36:06","okay and this machine has no IP address yet so in this case how can we make a connection we cannot so we cannot make a"
"11-02","36:14","connection that's why we must we must use UDP we cannot use TCP at transport"
"11-02","36:20","layer okay so now when this machine comes down to when this message comes"
"11-02","36:25","down to network layer and then we are adding a network clear header"
"11-02","36:32","okay and then it got comes on to link layer we are adding a link layer header"
"11-02","36:37","okay so this is the entire process and finally this message becomes zeros and"
"11-02","36:43","ones okay the link later we call it a frame okay transport layer record is a segment Network layer recorded datagram"
"11-02","36:49","and then link later we have the frame translated into zeros and a ones then it"
"11-02","36:55","is sent out okay okay and pay attention when this Frame is"
"11-02","37:02","sent out the frame is broadcasted to everybody how do we do the broadcast we know for"
"11-02","37:09","at the IP the IP address we know it should be 255 255 255 25 but when this"
"11-02","37:16","is implemented in reality at the link layer what we will do is we will make the MAC"
"11-02","37:24","address a bunch of apps okay 12 F's okay 12 apps"
"11-02","37:30","in total 48 bits online okay and I know"
"11-02","37:35","you have no idea about Mac address now but it's fine we will learn later okay"
"11-02","37:40","for now you just need to know a bunch of s okay this is how we do the broadcasting at the link layer"
"11-02","37:47","okay and then this message will be received by the dtcp server d2cb0 will"
"11-02","37:54","remove the headers layer by layer and finally deliver this DHCP message to the"
"11-02","38:02","application layer okay and then the DTC server will basically formulate a DCP"
"11-02","38:09","act response continuing all this information okay four pieces information"
"11-02","38:15","client address the IP address of 4-hub launcher the name and address of the"
"11-02","38:20","server and also the network mask actually okay so basic information will be or included and then send back"
"11-02","38:29","to the client okay then when the client receives it the client will remove the header layer"
"11-02","38:37","by layer and finally wrote the message to the application layer so this is a the entire process now the client knows"
"11-02","38:44","is IP address name and IP address of DNS server IP address always first hop"
"11-02","38:50","browser okay so this is a sample message you can see this is the left part is a"
"11-02","38:55","request message and it is requesting for subnet"
"11-02","39:01","the mean name the router's information that is the first gateway router and"
"11-02","39:08","first of all brownstra and also the domain name servers okay so then in the"
"11-02","39:14","reply you can see it is providing it is actually providing the client IP"
"11-02","39:20","address okay and it also provides the sub"
"11-02","39:26","Network mask information DNS servers information and the domain name okay so those"
"11-02","39:32","information are provided in the reply message okay so another question you may ask"
"11-02","39:40","further is okay I know the router or the dfcp"
"11-02","39:45","server can help assign IP address to a host but the question is how could a"
"11-02","39:52","network get the subnet part of the IP address that means okay you can assign"
"11-02","39:58","IP address but how do you know which IP addresses you can assign okay how does"
"11-02","40:03","the DHCP server know which IP address is to assign okay uh so the answer to this"
"11-02","40:11","question is that usually uh we need uh for a subnet it needs to get allocated"
"11-02","40:18","portion um from its price provider isp's address"
"11-02","40:25","space okay so basically for example this is the isps"
"11-02","40:31","um space okay outer space so basically this is one block okay it means the"
"11-02","40:38","first 20 bytes if you look at the network mask is 20 that means the first 20 bits are used for subnet and then the"
"11-02","40:46","remaining bits can be used for horse okay and then this is for the entire ISP"
"11-02","40:54","but if we have different organizations okay the ISP may decide to assign the IP"
"11-02","41:01","address range to different organizations so they may say okay"
"11-02","41:06","let me use this if we have eight organizations let me use these three"
"11-02","41:11","bits these three bits to distinguish those"
"11-02","41:18","eight organizations so you can see organization zero is zero zero zero and"
"11-02","41:23","this is zero zero one this is zero one zero and we continue until we have one one one okay so you can say for all"
"11-02","41:31","these uh organizations there first 20 fees are the same"
"11-02","41:38","but following those first 20 bits we have three more bits distinguishing those on organizations okay now we can"
"11-02","41:46","say okay for each organization the first 23 bits are used for subnet and then the"
"11-02","41:53","remaining nine piece are used for horse"
"11-02","41:59","okay and then of course the dtcp server for organization zero we all know okay"
"11-02","42:05","when I assign IP address I can assign the IP address 13 with this okay and the"
"11-02","42:13","first 20 therapies are for the subnet then remaining these are for the host"
"11-02","42:18","okay so this is how we can get um a portion of the address space okay"
"11-02","42:27","and these are kind of a hierarchical addressing is very useful actually"
"11-02","42:33","um because we know uh later we will learn in network layer in when we talk"
"11-02","42:38","about the routines and we will learn um the Network each sub-network needs to"
"11-02","42:46","advertise to others um which IP address is belong to this"
"11-02","42:52","network so for example um the California California's postal office"
"11-02","42:57","California's post office will need to advertise to the to the outside of"
"11-02","43:03","California say hey if you have any emails going to"
"11-02","43:08","um California then you can send it to me okay so that is uh AdWords advertisement"
"11-02","43:15","okay AdWords advertisement is very important and then"
"11-02","43:21","um you can say when we send advertisement okay we can aggregate those"
"11-02","43:30","um those organizations uh all those those routes those routine information for"
"11-02","43:37","example uh Sacramento County May Sacramento may say hey if you have any"
"11-02","43:42","mail sending to me send it to Sacramento Sacramento you can send it to me and uh"
"11-02","43:48","Los Angeles May say hey if you have any lectures going to Los Angeles you can send it to me so they are all doing"
"11-02","43:54","advertisements and then when it comes to California California May aggregate all"
"11-02","44:00","these advertisements combine them together and only see hey if you have"
"11-02","44:06","any letters going to California you can send it to me okay so it's like that it's like it's"
"11-02","44:12","the aggregation of those adversements so we can do the same thing in the internet as you can see for organization zero"
"11-02","44:20","okay he said hey um this this address space belongs to zero so"
"11-02","44:28","this belong to one this belongs to two this belong to seven and then when they are advertising to"
"11-02","44:36","the internet then this ISP can simply say hey if you have anything with address beginning"
"11-02","44:43","with this pay attention this is 20. okay with this"
"11-02","44:48","you can send it to me okay so why this is 20 because as you"
"11-02","44:54","can see here 20 means this entire ISP block"
"11-02","45:00","okay so 23rd is actually indicating each smaller each smaller organization so we"
"11-02","45:07","are doing algorithm we do not need to say one two three four until this eight okay we don't don't"
"11-02","45:14","need to say these eight organizations we can combine them together and only advertise this okay it's like you don't"
"11-02","45:21","need to advertise sacramental La San Francisco you can directly advertise"
"11-02","45:27","California it's like that okay and for different organizations or"
"11-02","45:32","different ISP they can see okay if you have anything with address beginning"
"11-02","45:38","um 1993100 16 and centimeters okay so we"
"11-02","45:43","select that and this is also very helpful for"
"11-02","45:49","relocating okay or relocation what does this mean so sometimes for example one"
"11-02","45:55","organization may decide to move from one ISP to another ISP we know it's very"
"11-02","46:03","common to change the ISP right so in this case in this case"
"11-02","46:10","do we need to change the IP address for this entire organization"
"11-02","46:15","okay for example now you can say organization one"
"11-02","46:21","okay organization one um change from this Flight By Night ISP"
"11-02","46:28","to ISP or us okay in this case we may not want to change"
"11-02","46:35","the IP address we may not want to change the IP address"
"11-02","46:40","for organization one okay because it's a lot of work we know especially if this organization is a big"
"11-02","46:48","organization okay the IP address may already be known by by the public okay"
"11-02","46:53","we don't want to change those then in this case if we directly move this"
"11-02","46:59","organization to another ISP without changing IP address some of you may"
"11-02","47:05","worry oh in this case this may create a problem when we do the routing"
"11-02","47:12","okay because this already said this already said send me anything with"
"11-02","47:18","addresses beginning with this okay it's like saying send me anything"
"11-02","47:23","beginning with California okay but what if a Sacramento decided to"
"11-02","47:28","move outside okay so what we can do now is"
"11-02","47:35","in addition in the new ISP in addition to the original address range we can add"
"11-02","47:41","something more we can just say okay if you if you have anything with address"
"11-02","47:46","beginning 199 something or 223 18 0-23 you can send it to me okay"
"11-02","47:57","so it's like saying oh if you have anything going to"
"11-02","48:03","um Pennsylvania or California Sacramento you can send it"
"11-02","48:09","to me it's like that okay"
"11-02","48:25","so you may see you may think oh then it's there is some confirm for example"
"11-02","48:31","if I send I have something going to Sacramento it's certify both conditions is it belongs to"
"11-02","48:39","California and it's also belonged to California Sacramento then in this case should I send the package to"
"11-02","48:45","the flyby Knight ISP or the SP Rus"
"11-02","48:51","can you guess can you type in the chat which one if we use one to represent this two to"
"11-02","48:58","represent this so if we have a package going to California Sacramento will you"
"11-02","49:05","send this to one or two okay we will choose to send to two"
"11-02","49:11","because we know California's Sacramento is a longer address it's more accurate"
"11-02","49:16","right so it's the same thing it's the same thing if you have an"
"11-02","49:22","address that matches both this sorry matches both this address and"
"11-02","49:28","also this address then please remember a principle we learned before that is"
"11-02","49:34","called the longest prefix matching then we will choose the one that matches"
"11-02","49:39","longer okay that matches longer so it's called longest prefix matching if you cannot"
"11-02","49:46","remember let me remind you"
"11-02","49:54","do you remember here we learned it right if it matches both"
"11-02","50:00","um addresses then we will choose the one that matches longer okay it's called longest prefix matching so that's why uh"
"11-02","50:09","this kind of hierarchical addressing is actually very flexible if we want to"
"11-02","50:14","move one organization from one ISP to another ISP this organization does not"
"11-02","50:22","need to change the IP addresses the only thing it needs to do is the ISP will"
"11-02","50:28","simply add this address space in its own advertisement okay so that's a"
"11-02","50:36","that's the thing and then you may also ask how can ISP get a block of addresses"
"11-02","50:42","the answer is that it will need to get this block of addresses from ICA and N"
"11-02","50:49","okay the internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers uh this"
"11-02","50:54","organization will allocated addresses manage the DNS and"
"11-02","50:59","assign the mean names uh result the disputes okay"
"11-04","0:03","all right so the next thing we are going to introduce is the nut Network address"
"11-04","0:11","translation okay uh I think you probably heard about the local network or the"
"11-04","0:19","um the internal Network those kind of terms okay"
"11-04","0:26","so um you can see here we have a router and"
"11-04","0:32","we have the local area network okay this this Loop Network can be home network"
"11-04","0:38","can be um campus Network or any local area network so then the left part left part"
"11-04","0:46","is the rest of the internet okay so Network address translation"
"11-04","0:52","basically means basically means we will use"
"11-04","0:58","a 10 zero zeros slash 24 as the"
"11-04","1:04","Network address for a local area network okay for local area network"
"11-04","1:12","and then all so you can see this clients are all assigned a IP address"
"11-04","1:19","within this range okay within this range then when this"
"11-04","1:25","when when the um datagrams for when a packet comes from one client"
"11-04","1:32","and goes through the router okay then"
"11-04","1:38","the packet will uh the source address was originally 1001 right so then when it goes out of"
"11-04","1:46","the round trip we will change the source address into this one"
"11-04","1:51","okay into a public address okay"
"11-04","1:57","then um this this is this is like for example for your family okay for my"
"11-04","2:04","family for example for my family San family okay um we may have a outside name like sun"
"11-04","2:12","okay but uh within our family we may simply name"
"11-04","2:18","ourselves one two three four like that okay and then for any other"
"11-04","2:26","families they also have an outside name okay but within their family they only"
"11-04","2:32","call themselves one two three four okay it's like that so in this case in"
"11-04","2:38","this case we will say all the datagrams leaving the local network have the same"
"11-04","2:45","single Source net IP address which is this one and they have different Source phone"
"11-04","2:51","numbers okay the diagrams with Source or definition in this network have this"
"11-04","2:57","address for source and destination okay I know you are you still maybe you"
"11-04","3:04","still feel like you you are confused okay"
"11-04","3:09","um we will explain more okay don't worry so why do they use net you think about"
"11-04","3:14","this you think about this okay one major reason is that we for IP"
"11-04","3:21","address it is 32-bit okay IP address is 32-bit that means for"
"11-04","3:29","this entire internet we have at most 2 to 32 IP addresses"
"11-04","3:39","pay attention this is not a large number this is actually a small number compared"
"11-04","3:44","to the number of devices we are having right now okay so we can run out IP addresses very"
"11-04","3:51","soon okay then people begin to think how can we address this problem"
"11-04","3:57","then they come out of one solution one solution is that how about for this"
"11-04","4:04","entire local area network they just use one IP address okay it's like public IP"
"11-04","4:11","address but internally they all use the IP address so ten zero"
"11-04","4:17","zero something okay then to the outside this entire"
"11-04","4:23","local area network uses only one IP address but actually they can they have"
"11-04","4:28","a lot of devices okay then for other local networks for example there is one maybe for sex date"
"11-04","4:36","okay and then for UCD we may have uh we may also use just one IP address okay"
"11-04","4:42","but we may have thousands of machines within that so we may we may denote those machines also within"
"11-04","4:50","1000 1000 slash something okay so basically"
"11-04","4:56","10 0 0 is is like a special address that"
"11-04","5:01","is used for net okay and then in this case in this case"
"11-04","5:07","an entire local area network only need one IP address but but we can actually"
"11-04","5:12","denote a lot of devices using the internal address okay so that is uh I would say one"
"11-04","5:21","motivation for using net I hope you understand this it's like for my family"
"11-04","5:27","to the outside we only use the Sun as the the public name okay but inside"
"11-04","5:33","we use one two three four and this one two three four can be reused by other families okay this name can be used by"
"11-04","5:40","other families in this way we do not occupy a lot of family family names okay it's like that"
"11-04","5:46","uh any questions"
"11-04","5:52","okay so then now let's look at the motivation the motivation we have"
"11-04","5:57","several more motivations and then we will discuss uh how that works okay"
"11-04","6:03","so the motivation uh for net is that the local network uses just one IP address"
"11-04","6:11","as far as outside world is concerned"
"11-04","6:16","because of that okay uh we also we all we also want to"
"11-04","6:21","do several things um several more things first thing the range our addresses"
"11-04","6:28","is not needed for my SP because we just need one IP address"
"11-04","6:34","for all the devices of course internally we still need to"
"11-04","6:39","distinguish those devices but we can just use the internal address okay 1000 something and this internal address can"
"11-04","6:47","be reused again and again for other local area networks okay"
"11-04","6:52","and then another benefit is if we want to change the addresses or"
"11-04","6:59","devices in the local network we do not need to notify the outside world"
"11-04","7:05","that means if someday I'm not happy about the architecture for my network I"
"11-04","7:10","can change the structure freely but I don't need to tell the outside Network okay"
"11-04","7:16","second benefit the third benefit we can also change the SP without changing the"
"11-04","7:24","addresses of devices in the local area network case one day we are not happy with the"
"11-04","7:29","internship we want to change to Comcast is fine you don't need to change the addresses"
"11-04","7:36","or devices in the local network although maybe the outside public IP address has"
"11-04","7:42","been changed okay and the fourth benefit is about security the"
"11-04","7:51","device is inside the local area network is not are not explicitly addressable or"
"11-04","7:57","visible by the outside world okay so this is very good because the outside"
"11-04","8:03","world cannot directly uh communicate or can cannot"
"11-04","8:09","directly address uh device within the local area network so this is adding a"
"11-04","8:16","layer of security actually okay so now let's look at how how uh is the"
"11-04","8:24","net implemented okay um so basically the net router must do"
"11-04","8:30","several things for the outgoing datagrams okay for the outgoing datagrams we need to replace the source"
"11-04","8:38","IP address and Source port number of every Optical integram to the next IP"
"11-04","8:46","address and a new phone number okay basically replacing the internal address"
"11-04","8:53","internal port number with some out um uh"
"11-04","8:59","external or we can see uh public IP address and a new phone number"
"11-04","9:05","okay and then uh of course when the remote clients or servers respond to this"
"11-04","9:12","package they will respond to the net IP address and the net port okay they will"
"11-04","9:19","not respond to this one because they do not know this one okay and then because they are responding to"
"11-04","9:27","this one then when it comes to when the response comes to the net router the net router"
"11-04","9:33","needs to replace"
"11-04","9:39","um the net address okay with the real IP address and port"
"11-04","9:46","number okay so that is uh what the net router should do let's look I mean I mean you"
"11-04","9:52","may be confused still no it doesn't matter let's look an example and you may feel uh clear okay"
"11-04","9:59","so now we have the internal addresses of 100123 and 4."
"11-04","10:07","okay and then we have a public address which is 138 76 29 7."
"11-04","10:15","and this router need to have a translation table next translation table"
"11-04","10:21","the next translation table has the one side and also the land side okay so now"
"11-04","10:28","we assume there is a packet from 1001 okay ten zero zero one cents a"
"11-04","10:36","datagram to this destination address this port number so you can see it is"
"11-04","10:41","communicating with a web server and then we know the source address"
"11-04","10:46","should be 1001 and Source Port is three through four five this is a real part that means"
"11-04","10:53","this computer is actually listening to this port okay the definition we know is 128 119 40 186"
"11-04","11:02","okay for Destination Port is 18. when this datagram come to the router goes"
"11-04","11:10","through the router the router will need to replace the source"
"11-04","11:16","address with the public address"
"11-04","11:21","okay and the source port number is also replaced it's replaced with 5001"
"11-04","11:29","okay and then"
"11-04","11:35","and then pay attention the next translation table in the net transformation table the router also"
"11-04","11:42","write down this pair write down this pair okay basically this support number of"
"11-04","11:48","5001 here is referring to this"
"11-04","11:55","IP address and port number pair okay five zero zero one is representing"
"11-04","12:02","this 1001345 pair okay and then this packet is sent to the"
"11-04","12:10","server the server will respond when the server respond you can see the server"
"11-04","12:15","actually is bounded to you can see the source address is the"
"11-04","12:20","original destination address this is Source address softball number the server is replying to"
"11-04","12:27","this public IP address and 5001 because this is what is provided to the"
"11-04","12:35","server okay what was provided to the server that's why the server is replying to this one and again when this package third goes"
"11-04","12:42","through the router the router will need to check this table and say okay this IP address and this"
"11-04","12:51","port number 501 is actually matched to 1001345"
"11-04","12:59","so this router will replace replace the destination address to the"
"11-04","13:06","original address which is 1001345 okay and then now the packet can"
"11-04","13:14","be sent to 1001.0045"
"11-04","13:19","okay so here pay attention this five zero zero one is that's a real"
"11-04","13:25","pot number is a is that a real port when I say real Port I mean is there any"
"11-04","13:32","machine listening to this port is there an emotion listening to 5001"
"11-04","13:39","the answer is no 5001 is not a real post number because"
"11-04","13:45","nobody is listening to this port instead this is more like a identifier"
"11-04","13:53","an ID to denote this address and sort and Port pair okay but this 3345 is a"
"11-04","14:03","real Port because this 1001 machine is actually listening to this port okay"
"11-04","14:08","foreign now if we have another machine"
"11-04","14:14","10002 for example if it is sending out a packet also"
"11-04","14:21","okay if we have at the land side if we have 1002"
"11-04","14:28","okay this machine is sending out a datagram with the spot number one two three four"
"11-04","14:33","and then when it goes through the one side we can use a different phone number to denote this pair"
"11-04","14:40","okay and some of you may ask what if what if we have the same machine 10001"
"11-04","14:50","but a different point number maybe four five six seven what if this is"
"11-04","14:57","going through the router what can we do should we also give it a new phone number the answer is yes"
"11-04","15:11","okay so in this case as long as there is something and as"
"11-04","15:17","long as either the IP address or port number is different then we will need to"
"11-04","15:22","assign a new phone number to that a new one-sided phone number so basically as I"
"11-04","15:27","said this port number this port number is used to identify"
"11-04","15:34","this pair okay not just the IP address or just the port number okay"
"11-04","15:40","so now you can see um if we come back to review"
"11-04","15:46","the motivation again the motivation is also the benefits okay so then we know okay"
"11-04","15:54","for this entire local network we only need one IP address one IP address for"
"11-04","16:00","all the devices okay and if we want to change the internal IP address we don't"
"11-04","16:06","need to notify the upside world if we want to change the ISP we don't need to"
"11-04","16:12","change the structure or the addresses or the devices in the local area network because they are all using"
"11-04","16:18","the internal address is 100 something okay um"
"11-04","16:24","and also the device is inside the local area network are not explicitly"
"11-04","16:30","addressable or visible by the outside world so now you can see oh yes we"
"11-04","16:35","indeed have those benefits okay and some some of you may worry"
"11-04","16:41","um so how many devices open numbers can"
"11-04","16:46","be accommodate okay so you don't need to worry too much because for port number"
"11-04","16:54","for post number is"
"11-04","17:00","so that means that we can have as much the 2 to 16"
"11-04","17:06","different pairs different IP address and the phone number pairs okay so"
"11-04","17:14","um usually that is I would say that is sufficient for a regular size Network"
"11-04","17:21","okay um so that means we have sixty thousand"
"11-04","17:26","SEMA we can have at most sixty thousand um around 60 000 simple continuous"
"11-04","17:33","connections with a single landside address okay and pay attention this next"
"11-04","17:39","translation table is actually um is actually Dynamic okay which means"
"11-04","17:45","for example when this first connection is done when the communication is down we can actually delete this one"
"11-04","17:52","we can we will remove this pair from the net translation table okay and then uh"
"11-04","17:59","this is a port number of five zero zero one can be reused by some other"
"11-04","18:04","connections okay that's why usually it's sufficient because we can have"
"11-04","18:10","um 2 to 16 simultaneous connections with one single Landslide address okay and"
"11-04","18:18","this is dynamically changing okay but that is also very it's also"
"11-04","18:23","controversial because uh we know we assume the routers should only process"
"11-04","18:29","up to layer 3 which means Network layer which means we only deal with the IP"
"11-04","18:35","addresses Etc in the network layer okay we should not we should not address deal"
"11-04","18:41","with the port numbers processes uh in the network layer right uh but you can"
"11-04","18:49","see that actually while it's this end-to-end argument that is dealing with"
"11-04","18:54","the processes okay why because net is dealing with the port number so we know Paul numbers are"
"11-04","19:01","associated with the processes okay so that's why net is actually uh"
"11-04","19:06","controversial and people are thinking oh uh net is a solution a good solution to"
"11-04","19:13","address shortage the IP address shortage but it's not the final eventual solution"
"11-04","19:19","which we need to find out some other Solutions that's why eventually the"
"11-04","19:24","address shorter problem is actually sold by the ipv4 sorry iqb6 okay IPv6"
"11-04","19:32","and another thing I want to quickly talk about is the icmp okay icmp is the full"
"11-04","19:38","name is internet control message protocol so this is used by the house and routers to communicate Network level"
"11-04","19:46","information uh basically this is for Arrow reporting for example if you have"
"11-04","19:51","some hosts and reachable or some Network unreachable some port and reachable okay"
"11-04","19:57","so you may do error reporting using icmt and sometimes this can also be useful"
"11-04","20:02","for Echo Equity requests or reply okay"
"11-04","20:08","um so icmp is actually um it's not it's still it still belongs to"
"11-04","20:15","network layer but it's also viewed as a layer above the IP there okay about the"
"11-04","20:23","um IP layer so that means um the icmp messages are actually"
"11-04","20:28","carried within the IP datagrams okay we will see that a lot later"
"11-04","20:34","so for the ICM key messages usually it contains uh the type the code and then"
"11-04","20:42","uh also the a short description okay and also your list can hit that"
"11-04","20:49","sorry not the crucial difference is actually the first eight bytes of iptogram causing the error so"
"11-04","20:56","um here is uh the different type and code actually means different things so this is the short description for the"
"11-04","21:03","type and code for example if you have type 3 code 0 that means the destination"
"11-04","21:12","network is not reachable if you have a type 3 code 1 that means"
"11-04","21:18","that that's neutral host is not reachable okay so I select that and"
"11-04","21:23","um I think we use the one thing before for example if it's type 11 code 0 this means TTL"
"11-04","21:32","expired okay if you still remember the trace route before we talk about Trace"
"11-04","21:39","routes before right so how is Trace router is done we we remember we know"
"11-04","21:44","um usually this client will need to send for example uh one package of course"
"11-04","21:54","usually each time we send out three for three probes okay but for all those three packets they have the TTL equal to"
"11-04","22:00","one okay so TTL was set to one and when they arrive at the router we will need"
"11-04","22:07","to minus one on the current GTL so 1 minus one TTL now because it becomes"
"11-04","22:12","zero okay so when it becomes zero when it becomes zero we know the TTL expires"
"11-04","22:20","okay when it expires then this router needs to send back an icmp message to"
"11-04","22:27","the source okay with type 11 code 0. so"
"11-04","22:32","type 11 equals zero this TTI expire then after this response is sent to the"
"11-04","22:40","client The Source The Source will write down this message okay and then it will"
"11-04","22:46","know okay the information about the first voucher the second time okay we will send out"
"11-04","22:53","TTL equal to True okay a second set with three probes this time the TTL is set to"
"11-04","22:59","two so two then that this means the practice can travel two hops so whether"
"11-04","23:06","it arrived at um the first round for TTL becomes one when to arrive that here TTL becomes two"
"11-04","23:14","sorry zero y minus one equal to zero and then"
"11-04","23:20","TTL expires we will need to send back to the source send send the this error"
"11-04","23:27","message to the source with type 11 code 0 okay at the same time this router will"
"11-04","23:34","also need to send back its own information so then with this when this message is received by The Source The"
"11-04","23:40","Source will record the name of the router and the IP address Etc okay"
"11-04","23:47","so we will continue until"
"11-04","23:52","um we reach the destination Okay so"
"11-04","23:57","then you can see in this process actually the trace around function is implemented with icmp"
"11-04","24:07","messages okay is implemented with icmp messages and the the reason that choice route can"
"11-04","24:15","work is because every time when the TTL expires the ICM icmp message with type"
"11-04","24:23","11 code 0 will be sent back to the source together with the router's"
"11-04","24:28","information okay so for the icmp"
"11-04","24:35","um this is uh the general information so we have first an icmp message and then we have the header then this entire"
"11-04","24:42","thing is actually uh encapsulated here in the datagram and with the IP header"
"11-04","24:51","okay IP header obviously this is actually a network layer header and then we have the datagram and then here is"
"11-04","24:59","actually right this should be link layer okay and then we have nuclear headers like that okay"
"11-04","25:06","um so you can see here in in this example"
"11-04","25:11","icmp is like the TCP or UDP right so you have the payload and then you have TCP"
"11-04","25:18","UDP header and then it is in capital state encapsulated within the datagram"
"11-04","25:24","and then you need to add the network layer header and then you add the link layer header it's like that okay"
"11-04","25:31","for net although it is a very good way to use um so the IP shorted problem it"
"11-04","25:38","is not the final solution as we mentioned because we suppose the router only deal with the network layer up to"
"11-04","25:45","the network layer right but net is dealing with the port numbers port number belongs to process okay which it"
"11-04","25:53","belongs further belongs to the transport layer so that's why we say oh okay net"
"11-04","25:59","is not the final solution then what is the final solution so the final solution is IPv6 so what is"
"11-04","26:09","IPv6 basically originally ipv4 in version 4 we have 32 bits as the IP"
"11-04","26:16","address now we want to make this much longer okay we want to make this much longer we"
"11-04","26:24","want to make this 128 bits the IP address we can make it 128 bits"
"11-04","26:32","then now we can accommodate 2 to 128 devices at least right we can that means"
"11-04","26:39","we can have we can have that many IP addresses for the entire world okay of"
"11-04","26:46","course there are some other motivations for IPv6 for example uh the header"
"11-04","26:51","format hubspeed processing or forwarding so basically we can add some information"
"11-04","26:57","in the header to help speed up this the processing okay"
"11-04","27:04","um and also uh the header uh changes are made to facilitate quality of uh service"
"11-04","27:12","okay that is another motivation um for the datagram format pay attention"
"11-04","27:20","for IPv6 for ipv4 we can still remember how many bits we um"
"11-04","27:27","how many bits we had so sorry how many bytes we had for the entire header so"
"11-04","27:34","generally it is uh 20 bytes for the entire handle ipv4 right so 20 plus"
"11-04","27:41","bytes as the header but for IPv6 um the the header lens is about 40 bytes"
"11-04","27:50","okay it's much longer one of the major reasons because the IP address becomes"
"11-04","27:56","longer so you can imagine original Source address destination address in total is 64 bits now it's a 128 times 2"
"11-04","28:05","which is a 256 bits okay and also for IPv6 we do not allow any fragmentation"
"11-04","28:13","no fragmentation is allowed if you still remember"
"11-04","28:18","we may learn about ipv4 one major component is actually fragmentation"
"11-04","28:25","fragmentation means as we said we have Network links right so some links are"
"11-04","28:33","um some links have a bigger capacity or bigger bandwidth something has a smaller"
"11-04","28:39","bandwidth then in this case uh and and they can accommodate and"
"11-04","28:46","comment the different the size of the package measurement maximum segment size"
"11-04","28:52","okay so then when a bigger packet comes to a narrow"
"11-04","28:58","link We how to break this bigger package into smaller pieces that is called"
"11-04","29:03","fragmentation but in IPv6 we do not allow fragmentation that's the that is"
"11-04","29:09","something you need to pay attention okay so then some of you may ask oh uh if we"
"11-04","29:17","do not allow fragmentation then what if a big packet comes to"
"11-04","29:24","a narrow link which can accommodate only small packets"
"11-04","29:29","what can we do so in this case we need to modify the icmp protocol"
"11-04","29:38","correspondingly okay in icmp protocol we need to add one more type"
"11-04","29:45","okay with one more code saying oh this packet is too big"
"11-04","29:50","okay now in this case if a pack is too big then this package will this uh um"
"11-04","29:56","package will be dropped and the Pat the error message will be sent back to the source and then the source Will based on"
"11-04","30:03","that will adjust the size of this packing and send a smaller one okay so that's how it works"
"11-04","30:11","um for IPv6 datagram format let's look at this together so basically each row is"
"11-04","30:19","32 bits which is four bytes"
"11-04","30:25","okay um and you can see"
"11-04","30:35","so this this will take four rows"
"11-04","30:41","this will take four rows"
"11-04","30:47","okay now you can see firstly we have the version number this shows V6 or V4 okay"
"11-04","30:55","now of course here it will be V4 V6 sorry and then we also have priority"
"11-04","31:01","priorities used to identify um uh priority among the datagrams in"
"11-04","31:08","the flow okay and we will also have the flow label although the concept of flow"
"11-04","31:13","is not well defined yet okay and then we will have the payload lens okay this is"
"11-04","31:22","the length of the payload pay attention which means the data the length of the data then this is the"
"11-04","31:30","next header next header basically means uh the upper layer protocol for the data"
"11-04","31:36","for example is our player TCP or UDP okay or even maybe icmp"
"11-04","31:43","and this is the Hop limit hop limit is similar to TTL and then we will have four rows of"
"11-04","31:51","source address which is which has a 128 bits and four rows of uh destination"
"11-04","31:58","address okay so you can say in total we have one two three sorry one two plus"
"11-04","32:06","eight so in total we have 10 rows"
"11-04","32:11","and we know each row is four bytes"
"11-04","32:18","so that is in total 40 bytes of data okay for device of data or 40"
"11-04","32:26","bytes of hydro we should say okay so now pay attention let's review all the"
"11-04","32:31","headers we have learned okay so for UDP we know the header length is uh it buys"
"11-04","32:38","for TCP the Headlands is about 20 bytes or 20 plus bytes"
"11-04","32:44","IP Windows about 20 bytes okay ipv4 IPv6"
"11-04","32:50","is about 4 device okay and there are some other changes from"
"11-04","32:57","ipv4 for example checksum is removed entirely to reduce the processing time"
"11-04","33:04","at each hop because we know for UDP and TCP they"
"11-04","33:09","have the checksum already so now we remove checksum at the network layer and"
"11-04","33:14","options are allowed but it is outside of the header it is indicated by The Nest"
"11-04","33:21","header field so if we have in the next header field if we have an indicator see"
"11-04","33:27","there is option then this option will will not be included in within the"
"11-04","33:33","header okay um and as I said as I said because we have a new version of I IP then we also"
"11-04","33:42","need a new version of icmp okay um so the additional message type may be"
"11-04","33:50","added such as package to big okay so those are uh the major changes"
"11-04","33:57","from ipv4 to V6 um but they're when we upgrade to IPv6"
"11-04","34:04","there is a problem we need to we need to address so the problem is basically me"
"11-04","34:10","is basically uh that we cannot we cannot upgrade all the routers"
"11-04","34:17","simultaneously that means we cannot say oh okay today"
"11-04","34:23","I'm going to shut down the entire internet and I will upgrade the router all"
"11-04","34:30","together can we do that we cannot so for the current Internet we cannot afford"
"11-04","34:37","such kind of flag dates okay then the problem becomes"
"11-04","34:43","um how could this network operate with a mixed ipv4 and V6 launchers so some"
"11-04","34:49","routers are able to read ipv4 packets some are"
"11-04","34:54","able to read ipvc vouchers so what can we do okay if a packet is traveling in"
"11-04","35:02","such kind of mixed routers then uh what can I do okay so then people began to"
"11-04","35:07","think um a very obviously very smart way okay it's called tunneling tunneling"
"11-04","35:13","basically means uh the IPv6 datagram is carried as the payload in the ipv4"
"11-04","35:24","datagram among ipv4 routers Okay so"
"11-04","35:30","usually usually for example IPv6 vouchers uh can still read itv4 packets"
"11-04","35:39","so um because IPv6 routers are more advanced"
"11-04","35:45","right so we can we can say okay you can backwardly accomplish those"
"11-04","35:51","um order format of packets but it's hard it's very hard for ipv4 routers to"
"11-04","35:59","understand the new package the IPv6 package okay so then in this case as I"
"11-04","36:05","said what we do is we basically incorporate"
"11-04","36:11","in we basically reported this this is this is actually our IPv6"
"11-04","36:21","so this is the IPv6 datagram it is put into an ipv4 datagram to view it as the"
"11-04","36:30","payload ipv4 payload okay then in addition to that we are"
"11-04","36:35","adding the ipv4 headers and ipv4 Source address destination address then this"
"11-04","36:42","IPv6 datagram is able to travel through"
"11-04","36:48","the old routers okay um so of course you can see in the IPv6"
"11-04","36:55","because this is this IPv6 Instagram is a complete dead form so you still have"
"11-04","37:01","IPv6 header fails uh the source Station address and also the udptcp payload"
"11-04","37:07","within this IPv6 datagram okay any questions so far"
"11-04","37:16","all right so let's look at this uh this view okay this is the tunneling"
"11-04","37:23","and we have those uh new routers IPv6 launchers and we also have ipv4"
"11-04","37:32","routers okay as we said if we have for example"
"11-04","37:38","um so you can you can view this as a tunnel okay you you can view those ipv4"
"11-04","37:44","routers as a Time Tunnel connecting those IPv6 launchers then if we have a"
"11-04","37:51","datagram from a for example the source is a destination is f"
"11-04","37:56","uh it is from one V6 router to another V6 router"
"11-04","38:02","okay so then we it might is traveling from A to B we know it is still a V6 uh"
"11-04","38:09","datagram then when it is traveling to"
"11-04","38:14","um to router C okay we know router C is the V4 router so then we have to you can see"
"11-04","38:22","we have to wrap this IPv6 datagram with a V4 uh headers okay with the V4"
"11-04","38:32","header so we basically added the source as B destination as e okay and then"
"11-04","38:40","this becomes a V4 package so it can travel through C and D finally it will"
"11-04","38:46","arrive at e okay when it arrived at e then e can remove the V4 header and take"
"11-04","38:53","out the V6 datagram and then it can continue travel to other V6"
"11-04","38:59","um routers okay so this is the entire process"
"11-07","0:09","so the next thing we are going to discuss is the routing algorithm so firstly let's review let's and this"
"11-07","0:17","part is very important okay routine algorithm is very important and it will definitely appear on the test"
"11-07","0:25","um let's review the routing and the forwarding again okay we learned that"
"11-07","0:31","each router will have a local forwarding table and if you record the router's structure"
"11-07","0:39","okay we learned the router has um the routine processor the switching"
"11-07","0:46","fabric the input ports and outputs so the routine processor is for running"
"11-07","0:53","the routing algorithm and then it will generate a local forwarding table so those this little"
"11-07","1:01","conference table will be executed by the switching fabric okay"
"11-07","1:08","so pay attention this local phone table is actually generated by running their organism I will show you how to do that"
"11-07","1:15","okay and we also learned um we also learned for example we only"
"11-07","1:21","need to check the destination address as the header and then we can decide uh"
"11-07","1:26","which output link to forward okay so it's it's like that if you look at the router sorry if you"
"11-07","1:34","look at the network the network actually can be viewed as a graph okay in this graph each node"
"11-07","1:45","okay or each router is a node and then the link between them is an edge okay so"
"11-07","1:51","this this will become uh the graph can be represented mathematically it can be"
"11-07","1:57","represented as G equal to a set of N and a set of e so N is a set of routers so"
"11-07","2:05","these are all the launchers and e is a set of links so for example the link between you and the way is this one"
"11-07","2:13","the link between you and you and X so please remember how we represent a"
"11-07","2:19","link we use this U we to represent a link between you and"
"11-07","2:26","we okay you know in final exam some uh one question requires students to write"
"11-07","2:31","down some links and some students just say way x w they do not they do not use"
"11-07","2:38","this kind of method to represent them the answer is wrong okay"
"11-07","2:44","so then the wrong team the routine problem is basically a shortest path"
"11-07","2:51","problem okay so for example if this is the sauce and if this is the destination then what"
"11-07","2:59","is the shortest path from U to Z okay so then these uh numbers 2 3 1 Etc"
"11-07","3:07","they can be viewed as the cost so what is the cost of the cost can be for example"
"11-07","3:14","um the distance okay or maybe uh the time spent on this link okay so you can"
"11-07","3:22","view this anyway our goal is that we want to find out the shortest path"
"11-07","3:29","between U and Z so then we can save time we can save efforts okay that is the the"
"11-07","3:37","essential goal for routine algorithm okay so now you can see we can represent the"
"11-07","3:44","cost C and the cost for the link x x Prime as c x x Prime"
"11-07","3:52","so for example uh cwdc wz the link"
"11-07","3:59","for between w and z has a cost of five okay"
"11-07","4:05","um and we can also calculate the cost of parts"
"11-07","4:10","the cost of path is um is for example if we have x 1 x 2 x 3 to"
"11-07","4:18","XP then the causal part is the cost between X1 and X2 plus the cost between"
"11-07","4:24","X2 and X3 and you continue until we finish uh all the notes okay for example"
"11-07","4:32","if we say uh the cost of U"
"11-07","4:37","x y z okay because for this path is one"
"11-07","4:42","plus one plus two equal to four okay so that's how we calculate the cost of path"
"11-07","4:49","um then the key question for routine algorithm becomes what is the least cost path"
"11-07","4:56","between you and the least cause the path between U and Z okay as I said the cost"
"11-07","5:04","can be distance uh can be time okay so then"
"11-07","5:09","um if this is distance then we can see this is the least the shortest path between um Z right"
"11-07","5:17","the purpose is to find out the least cost path okay"
"11-07","5:25","so there are two types of uh algorithm generally"
"11-07","5:30","um I shouldn't say two type maybe we can categorize in different uh aspects for"
"11-07","5:36","example if we consider uh if the outcome is global algorithm or decentralized"
"11-07","5:44","algorithm okay we will say for Global algorithm that means all the routers"
"11-07","5:51","have the complete topology of the entire network and they all know"
"11-07","5:58","that link cost information for each link okay so that is the link stage algorithm"
"11-07","6:05","so basically in this in this uh algorithm as I said every right I every"
"11-07","6:11","router will know uh the information for the entire network"
"11-07","6:17","okay this is global and another type is"
"11-07","6:22","decentralized algorithm decentralized algorithm the routers only know the"
"11-07","6:30","physically connected neighbors and also the link cost to Neighbors"
"11-07","6:36","okay um for example if I'm a router I only know oh okay I have three Neighbors so"
"11-07","6:44","if I go to neighbor one the cost is a 10 go to neighbor 2 the cost is five if I"
"11-07","6:50","go to neighbor 3 the cost is uh 12 maybe okay so all right only know the"
"11-07","6:56","information about my neighbors I do not care about the other routers this is"
"11-07","7:02","very very different from the global algorithm which in which the routers basically know all the information about"
"11-07","7:10","um the entire network okay um and then"
"11-07","7:16","basically for this kind of action we're not we need to do iterative"
"11-07","7:22","um iterative process of computer computation and then we need to exchange"
"11-07","7:27","the information with the neighbors the neighbors will do the calculation based"
"11-07","7:32","on the information provided by neighbors and I believe the neighbors again so"
"11-07","7:38","it's like that until finally we reach some kind of equilibrium equilibrium"
"11-07","7:43","okay or some kind of balance uh so one of the example is the distance"
"11-07","7:48","Vector algorithm okay so this is a uh the characterization if we're we are"
"11-07","7:55","categorized in um Global or decentralized if we are"
"11-07","8:00","categorized um in terms of static or dynamic then uh"
"11-07","8:06","one type of one type of algorithm is the static algorithm in which the routers"
"11-07","8:12","change the robs change slowly over time okay but for the dynamic once the Rocks"
"11-07","8:20","may change more quickly so we may do periodic update in response to the cost"
"11-07","8:26","changes okay so those are the different types"
"11-07","8:32","um so next let's look at the link State algorithm again we may not be able to finish this but let's uh at least maybe"
"11-07","8:41","try so for link State algorithm"
"11-07","8:47","um it's actually um built on top of the diecast algorithm"
"11-07","8:53","I think you have all learned like stress algorithm in 130 probably okay"
"11-07","9:00","um in directors we know we we firstly have the network topology and the link"
"11-07","9:06","costs are known to all the nodes okay uh how how can we make the link cost known"
"11-07","9:12","to everybody we do the broadcasting right next day broadcasting all the notes have the same information"
"11-07","9:18","uh and then based on those information we compute the least cost path from one"
"11-07","9:24","node to the to all the other nodes in that constructs algorithm uh human 30"
"11-07","9:32","probably you have learned uh the calculation or shortest path from one"
"11-07","9:38","note from source to destination right so but in next state housing our goal is"
"11-07","9:47","to calculate the shortest path or the least cost path from the source"
"11-07","9:53","to every other node that means we need to calculate the shortest path between U"
"11-07","10:00","and away between U and X between U and W between U and Y between U and Z so from the"
"11-07","10:08","source to every other node we need to know the shortest path because only"
"11-07","10:15","um only when we know the short part from or the least cost part from the source"
"11-07","10:21","to every other node then we will know how to do the forwarding when we see a"
"11-07","10:27","destination address okay so for example if we know this is the shortest path to w"
"11-07","10:33","then um if we know the destination node is W then we can forward this to uh to the UV"
"11-07","10:41","link okay so it's like that we will learn more uh but for now we need to know okay we are calculating the least"
"11-07","10:47","cost path from one node The Source node to all the other nodes okay all the"
"11-07","10:54","other nodes um and with me um do this alternatively after K"
"11-07","11:02","iterations we know the least cost path to K destinations okay so here we need"
"11-07","11:09","to firstly know some of the notations for example 6X and y means the link cost from node X"
"11-07","11:16","to node to Y and if they are not direct neighbors If X and Y are not Iraq"
"11-07","11:23","neighbors then this number will become Infinity okay"
"11-07","11:30","d y is the current value of the cost of path from source to destination weight"
"11-07","11:39","okay for example for example DW"
"11-07","11:46","if we know this this is the path we are looking at then DW will be 5 because that is the"
"11-07","11:54","cost from the source 2 W so it's 2 plus 3 equal to 5. select that okay"
"11-07","12:03","um and then PV is the predecessor note along the path from source to weight"
"11-07","12:11","again if we are looking at you we W then"
"11-07","12:18","PW on this path PW equals to we and PV"
"11-07","12:24","equals to you okay again we are looking at only this path we are not looking at"
"11-07","12:30","others of course if you are looking at others for example u x y z then pz will"
"11-07","12:37","become y p y become x p x become U so it's predecessor okay"
"11-07","12:44","and M Prime is the set of nodes whose least cost path definitely not okay so"
"11-07","12:52","basically this is a set a set of nodes if we or for example if"
"11-07","12:57","we already find out the least cost path between you and the way okay so then we"
"11-07","13:04","will add we we will put way to uh this uh M Prime"
"11-07","13:10","later if we find out the least cost part from uh source to W then we will change"
"11-07","13:18","this after this and put W into this set okay so our goal as we said our goal is"
"11-07","13:27","to compute the least cost path from The Source node to every other node okay"
"11-07","13:35","that means our goal is to finally put all the other nodes into this set of M"
"11-07","13:41","Prime okay any questions so far"
"11-07","13:48","I know this is a lot of information uh but gradually you will learn how to"
"11-07","13:54","use those okay basically we are I'm providing four notations uh the cost the"
"11-07","14:00","current value of the past cost the predecessor and the set of nodes okay"
"11-07","14:07","so this is a direct stress algorithm all right so then now let's look at the"
"11-07","14:13","dark stress algorithm of so firstly we need to do initialization"
"11-07","14:19","in the initialization for the M Prime we put U here only the source only the"
"11-07","14:26","source as I said our goal is to put all the other nodes into M Prime okay now it has only the sauce because we know the"
"11-07","14:33","shortest path from sauce to the source okay and for all the other nodes if the V or"
"11-07","14:43","the other notes away if V is adjacent to you okay then DV equals to the cost between"
"11-07","14:51","U and away that means if you and V for all the other nodes if you and we are direct"
"11-07","14:59","neighbors then we basically uh give the current plus value as the the link value"
"11-07","15:06","the link cost okay otherwise then"
"11-07","15:11","um it is infinity okay so for example"
"11-07","15:17","um it's basically the initialization if for example if for you and away are the right neighbors then we can see DV when"
"11-07","15:24","we do the initialization DV equals to see you wait which is true okay but then"
"11-07","15:32","DJ will equal to c u z which is actually Infinity so that's how we do the"
"11-07","15:39","initialization okay and then later we will find we will"
"11-07","15:45","enter a loop okay in this Loop we will find out find the W not in the M Prime"
"11-07","15:51","such that the DW is a minimum okay if we find out DW is a minimum then"
"11-07","15:59","we add W to M Prime okay in this case"
"11-07","16:04","because W is ended to added to M Prime then all the other nodes will try to go"
"11-07","16:11","through W okay they will need to update their own d-way"
"11-07","16:16","by considering going through W if they go through W then it's basically"
"11-07","16:23","uh the total cost will be currently W's cost"
"11-07","16:29","because DW means the constitute from W to U right"
"11-07","16:34","and then plus the cost between you and the weight so this is the total cost"
"11-07","16:41","so it's like if my neighbor told me say hey I have the shortest path to go"
"11-07","16:48","to New York okay and you need to take only two days to go to New York"
"11-07","16:54","then I will update my own time I will say okay if we if I go through you and"
"11-07","17:03","you only need to take two days to New York then I know between me and my"
"11-07","17:09","neighbor I need to take one more day okay then two days plus one more day I"
"11-07","17:15","know this is three days okay if I go through W go through my neighbor it is three days then I'll"
"11-07","17:23","compare this three days with my original time originally if I do not go through W"
"11-07","17:29","my the time I used to to travel to New York is probably seven days and now I"
"11-07","17:35","only need three days of course I will choose the minimal one okay so basically"
"11-07","17:40","you can say that all the notes will update there their value"
"11-07","17:48","by going through w okay and if we get a new cost"
"11-07","17:53","okay then we will find the shortest path now okay for example for me I I only"
"11-07","17:59","need three days okay then I will need to update this to three days okay and then I will need"
"11-07","18:06","to update my path my path originally is probably going through another neighbor but now I need to go through w"
"11-07","18:13","okay so that is my shortest path now and then uh later because this node way"
"11-07","18:22","um we can find out the shortest path then we will add way into M Prime"
"11-07","18:28","okay so it's like that so we will continue but after we add a way into M"
"11-07","18:35","Prime than another note we are update again based on"
"11-07","18:40","the value provided by weight okay then everybody will say oh now"
"11-07","18:46","let's try a new neighbor wait because this week is this is a has a shortest"
"11-07","18:51","path so then everybody try away and then try to find out the shorty path again so"
"11-07","18:58","we will do this until all the nodes are in the M Prime"
"11-07","19:04","okay are in the M Prime uh I know this is probably very overwhelming for so far"
"11-07","19:11","um so diagram algorithm is able to compete compute the least cost path from"
"11-07","19:19","one node to another node okay here following State album we want to calculate the least cost path from one"
"11-07","19:26","node to all the other nodes okay so basically for example if you are"
"11-07","19:31","looking at this this example here we have Source node and then we will view every other node"
"11-07","19:39","at the destination node and then we calculate the shot the least cost path"
"11-07","19:44","from The Source node to every other node for example we may do"
"11-07","19:51","um we want to calculate the list called path from U to X from U to W from U to v"
"11-07","19:57","u to y u to Z okay um and uh again let me review the notations"
"11-07","20:04","again so for for example c x y is the link cost from node X node y"
"11-07","20:11","if they are direct neighbors for example uh c x y"
"11-07","20:16","okay if they are direct neighbors okay their cost is uh just the link cost"
"11-07","20:22","between them for example in this example is 7 for c x y right but if they are not"
"11-07","20:29","derivative for example c u z for cuc because U and z are not your"
"11-07","20:36","enabled so we cannot provide a link cost to it then the link cost we will use"
"11-07","20:41","during initialization is the infinity okay and then D way is the current value of"
"11-07","20:48","the cost of path from source to destination"
"11-07","20:53","so for example if we are looking at u x y you u x y okay then d y equal to 5 plus"
"11-07","21:07","7 equals to twelve so that is a uh the value of cost for path okay then PV is"
"11-07","21:17","the predecessor node along the path from source to a node weight okay for example"
"11-07","21:26","for example um on this path u x y we may have p y at"
"11-07","21:34","equal to X because y's predecessor is X okay and then p x equals to you all"
"11-07","21:42","right um then M Prime is the set of nodes whose least cost path uh is definitely"
"11-07","21:49","no as we said our goal is to put every node into M Prime that means our goal is"
"11-07","21:57","to calculate the least cost path from the source to every other node okay"
"11-07","22:05","so now to write our algorithm we need to uh we first list all those steps for the"
"11-07","22:13","first step for the first step okay we will need to initialize uh some of the"
"11-07","22:19","values for example we need to look at the D's okay that means"
"11-07","22:26","uh the cost of path from the source to"
"11-07","22:31","way to W to X to Y to Z okay of course depending on different paths this values"
"11-07","22:37","may difference may be different okay um and then we will look at the piece"
"11-07","22:43","okay the predecessors for every node okay later we will use those"
"11-07","22:49","predecessors um to draw the list cost path tree okay"
"11-07","22:55","for now let's do the initialization for at the very beginning we can put U into"
"11-07","23:01","M Prime why because as we said as we said"
"11-07","23:08","um we uh M Prime means the set of nodes that we have already found out the least"
"11-07","23:14","cost path so from U to you our course we know from itself to itself okay uh we"
"11-07","23:21","know uh the shortest path is is going through itself right so that's why we"
"11-07","23:26","put you into M Prime and then we need to do initialization of the D's okay the"
"11-07","23:32","distances so for example is gonna be from U to we and then you"
"11-07","23:42","can say from you to way this is actually um seven so that's why you can see this"
"11-07","23:48","is the seven and the predecessor away is actually you"
"11-07","23:56","okay that's way so then we look at w because"
"11-07","24:01","we are in the first step the very first step is just initialize this we just look at uh look at uh the uh direct"
"11-07","24:09","neighbors not direct we look at each node and see if there are different numbers with the source okay and then we"
"11-07","24:16","look at w for w we know between U and W the COS is third and we know now the"
"11-07","24:24","predecessor is U predecessor for w p w is actually U"
"11-07","24:30","same thing for X for X we know u x equal to 5 and the predecessor of X is also U"
"11-07","24:39","okay the half of the Y U and Y are not direct Neighbors"
"11-07","24:46","okay so that's why we cannot put any value there we can just put Infinity okay we cannot put um"
"11-07","24:53","a specific number there okay the same thing for z z and U are not"
"11-07","25:00","your neighbors so their cost the cost for the path of use is infinity okay so"
"11-07","25:08","this is what we know currently and that among those values"
"11-07","25:14","among those values among all those nodes v w x y z currently what is the shortest path to"
"11-07","25:22","reaching you and you can easily know okay W has the"
"11-07","25:27","smallest value right so w has the least cost path to you"
"11-07","25:34","okay so now we found out the list cost path from W to U then we choose W and we"
"11-07","25:42","put W here okay and then"
"11-07","25:48","because W is currently the least cost path to you everybody else will will try"
"11-07","25:54","W so w is very proud WC hey I have the best pass so far okay"
"11-07","26:01","if you want to reach to the destination sorry it reach to the source U okay go"
"11-07","26:07","try me try me I may give you a surprise okay so it's like that and then"
"11-07","26:12","everybody try w we will try w we try w"
"11-07","26:19","so when we go through w we use W's original value it is which is a third"
"11-07","26:24","okay plus the cost of three so three plus three is six it's a smaller than"
"11-07","26:32","the original value of seven that's why we put 6 here and now we know that which"
"11-07","26:37","predecessor is not U anymore it is actually w"
"11-07","26:42","so we put a w here okay and then W do not need to try itself"
"11-07","26:50","again we skip W the X will try w"
"11-07","26:55","so X try W again we use currently w we know DW is three okay so three plus four"
"11-07","27:03","is seven seven is not better than five that's why X will see that's not a"
"11-07","27:09","better solution so I'll keep five e okay and then y will try w why Try W again"
"11-07","27:17","what eight plus three is eleven eleven is actually better than infinity so"
"11-07","27:26","that's why we put 11 here and then the predecessor of Y is"
"11-07","27:31","actually W so we put W here and how about Z if they want to try"
"11-07","27:39","um w we know there is no direct link between w and z so it doesn't improve we"
"11-07","27:47","just put Infinity there still So currently among the remaining notes we know now X"
"11-07","27:57","X has the shortest part the least cost path to you right so"
"11-07","28:06","and then we can put X into M Prime because we find out the least cost path"
"11-07","28:14","from X to you okay the x is now very proud X will see"
"11-07","28:20","hey everybody try me please you may find some surprise okay then we will try X"
"11-07","28:28","pay attention we has no direct link with acts so that's why we will just do"
"11-07","28:37","6w still and we skip w we skip X then y will try"
"11-07","28:43","X so now we know DX equals to five okay y"
"11-07","28:51","Prime X and then you can see five plus seven"
"11-07","28:58","equals to 12. 12 is not better than"
"11-07","29:03","11. so that's why why we all just give up and still keep 11 W how about z z try"
"11-07","29:12","x 0 x is five plus nine equals to 14 so we say oh this is better"
"11-07","29:19","than infinity so now this predecessor is a x"
"11-07","29:26","okay because it's going through X and now among all of these we say okay"
"11-07","29:32","now we know the this course part from we to U"
"11-07","29:38","so then we put u w x we put a v here"
"11-07","29:44","okay then we know now DV equals to 6."
"11-07","29:51","okay and then everybody try way so we have"
"11-07","29:57","only Y and Z remaining why they are trying V then four plus six is ten ten is"
"11-07","30:05","actually better than 11 so this is a 10 and the predecessor we know this is away"
"11-07","30:12","so pay special attention here many students made a mistake so many students"
"11-07","30:17","will they forgot we put a d y equal to 6 here that what they will do is oh why"
"11-07","30:24","Try V we had seven seven plus four is eleven it's not better"
"11-07","30:30","that is absolutely wrong that is wrong because you just you you ignore the"
"11-07","30:36","other past other parts you just directly look at the direct link between you and"
"11-07","30:42","me that is actually wrong because by um through our previous steps we have"
"11-07","30:49","learned the the shortest path or the least cost path for we actually has a"
"11-07","30:56","cost of six that's what we have learned that's the one you have to use can we do"
"11-07","31:01","further calculation you cannot use seven no pay attention to that many students"
"11-07","31:06","made mistakes um here okay and then see we are also"
"11-07","31:11","trying it so if they try V then you say"
"11-07","31:16","they have did not have any direct link so that's why they will still do 14 and"
"11-07","31:22","X then among Y and Z we know we have to choose y"
"11-07","31:28","so u w x v and y now you know why we"
"11-07","31:34","have already find out the least cost path for between uh between U and Y okay then everybody"
"11-07","31:43","try y Z is the only the remaining one so then"
"11-07","31:49","we know d y now equal to 10 okay you don't want to do calculation on your own"
"11-07","31:56","again uh for d y you can directly take uh the value from what you have"
"11-07","32:01","calculated before okay so then d y equal to 10 they say that now equals to ten"
"11-07","32:09","plus two okay equals 12 12 is better so then the predecessor for Z this time"
"11-07","32:18","is y okay because this is the only one so we have"
"11-07","32:23","nothing else to choose we just put Z here"
"11-07","32:29","now we have put every node into M Prime that's how we fill this table and then"
"11-07","32:37","you may ask what do we do with this table okay what do we do with this table very interestingly okay I just"
"11-07","32:47","you can see uh it is displaying what we have discussed"
"11-07","32:53","okay okay so the next thing we we are going"
"11-07","33:00","to do is to this to construct to construct the least cost path tree"
"11-07","33:06","okay so let me"
"11-07","33:12","so just clean this up okay but I I'll keep those d d x d v d y Etc there okay"
"11-07","33:22","so then now uh we know okay so now we will connect we want to"
"11-07","33:29","construct the list called the shortest path tree or the list cost path tree okay so what we should do now is we"
"11-07","33:37","connect every node with its predecessor so for example you can see uh for Z we"
"11-07","33:44","know the predecessor is actually y then we will connect z and y here okay and"
"11-07","33:51","then for y the predecessor is way so we connect to Y and we"
"11-07","33:56","okay then for X the predecessor is actually U if you look at the table so X"
"11-07","34:02","and u and for w the predecessor is u"
"11-07","34:08","okay and then the way predecessor is w"
"11-07","34:14","now you can see what we I have drawn here is actually the least cost path tree or"
"11-07","34:22","the shortest path trick okay so between U and X"
"11-07","34:27","between unw so all these ones so is the discourse pathway so what does"
"11-07","34:35","this mean this means if you want to reach to any node you just follow this"
"11-07","34:41","list cost pathway for example if you want to reach X then follow ux"
"11-07","34:48","if you want to reach W then follow UW if you want to reach way then do u w and"
"11-07","34:55","then WV if you want to reach y then follow UW wa"
"11-07","35:01","and v y if you want to reach Z the same thing you do UW wa"
"11-07","35:07","v y and then y z okay so that is how you follow uh the"
"11-07","35:15","least cost path to 3 to reach every destination okay so that means if you"
"11-07","35:21","have a packet coming in with a specific destination for example if the definition is is y"
"11-07","35:28","then we know the least cost path for this package is to go through"
"11-07","35:35","uwwe and then we y okay so that's what we do and then interestingly now you can"
"11-07","35:42","see if you stand at this uh Source you okay then when the packet comes in you"
"11-07","35:51","know how to do the forwarding okay so for example for example"
"11-07","35:58","if this is the destination"
"11-07","36:10","if the left column is destination the right column is the outgoing link"
"11-07","36:16","then we know if the destination is X"
"11-07","36:22","okay we should forward this to u x"
"11-07","36:28","right we forward it to this link if the addition is w we need to forward"
"11-07","36:34","it to you w we follow the list cost path tree okay"
"11-07","36:39","now I have a question you can type the answer in the chat"
"11-07","36:45","what if the definition is V what is the outgoing link"
"11-07","36:52","what if the destination is a way what is the"
"11-07","36:58","outgoing link pay attention you need to write down a"
"11-07","37:06","link not just one node okay a link so how to"
"11-07","37:11","express a link you need a parenthesis"
"11-07","37:17","um apparently some of you are considering oh because definition is a way so I need to forward this to UW"
"11-07","37:26","um and then to wait okay that is very normal"
"11-07","37:31","but that is actually wrong why because because"
"11-07","37:38","when the router do the forwarding okay the router can forward it to only its"
"11-07","37:46","own neighbors it cannot control others it's like for me I have for example for"
"11-07","37:53","you it has three neighbors of x w and we it can only decide"
"11-07","38:00","if it need it should be forwarded to X or to W or to wait"
"11-07","38:05","but it cannot decide what will happen after that that means for you you can only say oh I"
"11-07","38:13","need to forward it to this link to the UW link okay but what will happen after w"
"11-07","38:23","is not decided by you you don't care okay you doesn't care"
"11-07","38:29","so that's why I pay special attention here you can only write down UW you should not add WB okay no wa and some of"
"11-07","38:39","you may think then how can I decide how can I how can I make sure"
"11-07","38:46","um W is doing the job W is forwarding this two-way we cannot we cannot control W okay we"
"11-07","38:53","cannot make sure that um as a matter of fact W will run its"
"11-07","39:00","routing algorithm and generating its own forwarding table okay so what you is"
"11-07","39:08","doing now is to make the best judgment based on the gravity algorithm it is"
"11-07","39:15","running it can only tell oh from what I understand I need to forward this to W"
"11-07","39:21","but I don't know what will happen after that W may have a different opinion W"
"11-07","39:27","may make me forward it to to something else not to wait okay but W is running"
"11-07","39:33","its own routing algorithm and generating its own local formative table that is"
"11-07","39:39","something you need to pay us pay attention Okay pay attention"
"11-07","39:44","and then if the destination is uh y so can you guess the answer now can you"
"11-07","39:51","type in the answer in the chat now what is the outer link outgoing link if the"
"11-07","39:57","destination is y the answer should be u w again U is only controlling"
"11-07","40:05","itself this is the local"
"11-07","40:18","pay attention because you know what we are doing is a local forwarding table for you not for anybody else okay for"
"11-07","40:24","you okay um Anthony is asking uh so we assume the"
"11-07","40:30","machine will take care of the inputs yes the machine will look at look at uh I"
"11-07","40:36","don't know what you mean by inputs if you are meaning the destination of the package yes the the router will look at"
"11-07","40:43","the destination destination of the packet and then decide the outgoing link"
"11-07","40:49","okay so what is this what if the definition is z so what is that green link"
"11-07","40:57","so if the definition is Z then the um forwarding link the outgoing link is"
"11-07","41:04","still UW okay because we are looking at only the local 40 table for you okay you"
"11-07","41:12","will make the decision based on the destination of the package okay and it"
"11-07","41:18","can only forward to Three Links number one is the uwx number two is the UW and"
"11-07","41:26","then number three is the UE one okay so I'll remove this just to"
"11-07","41:36","okay um so there is another example"
"11-07","41:43","another example"
"11-09","0:03","there is another example another example here below"
"11-09","0:11","let's do the get this together and we take U as the source okay the first step"
"11-09","0:17","is the initialization so you can say for we it is 2 K for X we know for is two"
"11-09","0:25","and the predecessor is u for w we have a direct link between U and W so"
"11-09","0:31","the value is 5 and predecessor is U for X the value is 1 u x is one and the"
"11-09","0:40","predecessor of X is U for y u y do not have direct link so infinity and DZ uh"
"11-09","0:48","have no direct link so Infinity so this is the first line very easy the second line if you look at the first"
"11-09","0:55","line we know okay among these nodes X apparently have the least cost parts"
"11-09","1:01","right so the least cost so then d x equals to"
"11-09","1:07","one okay we choose X and put X into M Prime then everybody try X when you try"
"11-09","1:14","X we try X we know this is 2 plus 1 equals to 3 is not better so that's why"
"11-09","1:20","we still keep to you here and if you look at w"
"11-09","1:25","Tri X so it's 3 plus 1 is equal to four four is better than five so that's why"
"11-09","1:32","we have four here and then we have X as the predecessor"
"11-09","1:37","okay uh we skip X we look at y y try X so 1"
"11-09","1:44","plus 1 equal to 2 is better than infinity so we put two here and then the"
"11-09","1:49","predecessor is X they try x no direct link between x and"
"11-09","1:54","z so it's your Infinity now um in the second line among or a second row among"
"11-09","1:59","all of these we say a tie between we and Y okay so you can choose any one of them"
"11-09","2:08","you may have the confusion there you can choose either way or why both are fine"
"11-09","2:13","and they will generally the same result okay of course here in our example"
"11-09","2:19","um and in slide it chooses uh y okay it's"
"11-09","2:24","put y here of course you can try way on your own and see if you can generate the same thing okay"
"11-09","2:30","so now we know okay Y is put uh into the M Prime"
"11-09","2:36","okay everybody try y d y now equal to two Okay so we try Y no direct link"
"11-09","2:45","between we and Y but we doesn't change W 20y is one plus two equals to 3 which"
"11-09","2:54","is better than four so we put three here and Y is the predecessor for w"
"11-09","3:01","okay and then they try y is 2 plus 2 equal to four four is better"
"11-09","3:07","than infinity so we put 4y here okay because predecessor for Z is y now"
"11-09","3:14","among all of these we know we has the smallest value so then we try D we"
"11-09","3:23","equals to 2 then everybody twice we um"
"11-09","3:29","and we also put a v into n Prime so w try away W Tri V okay it's the third"
"11-09","3:37","plus two equal to 5 is not better so w will still keep through Y"
"11-09","3:43","and they try one uh they try V okay they"
"11-09","3:49","try away there is no direct link between J and uh way so it's still capable y"
"11-09","3:56","okay then among these two we choose apparently we choose W okay"
"11-09","4:03","so then d w now equals 2 3. okay then"
"11-09","4:09","everybody try W only Z is only the only remaining one so they will try W is 3"
"11-09","4:16","plus 5 equals to eight which is not better than four that's why we still"
"11-09","4:23","keep four y here okay and then we put because this is the"
"11-09","4:28","only remaining one so we put uh they here uh into the last line then we are"
"11-09","4:33","done with this table now what what we need to do next is we want to construct the least cost path"
"11-09","4:40","tree so we connect Z and its predecessor which is y"
"11-09","4:47","z and y okay and Y"
"11-09","4:52","and X Y and X and u"
"11-09","4:59","X and u okay w and y"
"11-09","5:06","w n y then we and u"
"11-09","5:14","okay so you can see this is the least cost path tree"
"11-09","5:22","now we know now let's construct the forwarding table"
"11-09","5:33","okay"
"11-09","5:45","it's still for you okay so then if the destination is way then we need to"
"11-09","5:51","forward it to you wait if the definition is X we need"
"11-09","5:58","to forward it to u x what if the definition is uh"
"11-09","6:05","um y what should we do if the definition is a y we should"
"11-09","6:11","forward it to we need to follow this u x y link right so we should still need to"
"11-09","6:18","forward this to u x what if the definition is w"
"11-09","6:23","we need to forward this to u x and then X to y y to W so it's c o u x"
"11-09","6:31","okay if Danisha is they then we need to forward it to steal u x"
"11-09","6:39","okay any questions this is how we construct the local"
"11-09","6:46","forwarding table for um for you this link State album as I said"
"11-09","6:52","will definitely appear on the test please pay special attention to that okay"
"11-09","6:58","and you can see this is uh actually what we have discussed just now it's the same thing okay so I got just skip this part"
"11-09","7:06","uh if we look at the digital algorithms complexity then each node we have nodes"
"11-09","7:12","okay in each iteration we need to check all the other nodes okay not e and Prime"
"11-09","7:18","so that means we need to check n minus one nodes plus M minus two nodes"
"11-09","7:27","plus n minus three nodes and here we have and notes a one notes okay so the total"
"11-09","7:36","of this is one plus and minus one"
"11-09","7:43","times and minus 1 divided by 2."
"11-09","7:48","so this is actually so this is this is actually o big and"
"11-09","7:55","two okay uh so we need to do that many comparisons"
"11-09","8:03","um of course if you consider also uh the unknowns in the very first iteration"
"11-09","8:10","when we do initialization then this will become n Plus this okay so then this will become"
"11-09","8:18","um this will become 1 plus n times n so then this becomes n square plus n still"
"11-09","8:26","Big O and two okay there is some more efficient implementations which have the"
"11-09","8:34","O uh and log in complexity okay but we will not discuss those"
"11-09","8:41","um and it makes up from oscillation problem that oscillation problem basically means"
"11-09","8:48","um because we are considering the shortest path every time so every time if if the"
"11-09","8:55","traffic we know if the traffic is uh um is uh actually related to the link cost"
"11-09","9:04","right so when when the traffic is more busy then the cost is higher okay the"
"11-09","9:12","cost is higher than because then when if we run this algorithm we will choose the uh the the the the path with less"
"11-09","9:20","traffic okay um but it's it's like when you uh so but"
"11-09","9:25","it's it's like when you drive on the road okay for example you feel like oh uh this pass is very busy"
"11-09","9:33","okay I have to wait so how about I choose this one okay I choose that part"
"11-09","9:38","initially okay and then after you everybody everybody let me choose this"
"11-09","9:44","one and then the traffic becomes more heavy on this path"
"11-09","9:50","and now the time is increasing so then everybody"
"11-09","9:56","now switch back to the other parts because the other parts has less traffic so it's like that so we continue"
"11-09","10:03","switching back and forth so it's this is called oscillation problem it's like when you drive on the road"
"11-09","10:09","I think many of you have noticed if you drive on one lane and this Lane has uh"
"11-09","10:16","it's very very slow and you may get impatient you you say oh let me switch to the the other fasterly and then you"
"11-09","10:24","may notice after you switch to the faster line and the faster line becomes slower so"
"11-09","10:30","you have to switch back so you're doing this back and forth that is actually exactly uh uh the the obviously the best"
"11-09","10:38","analogy for this oscillation problem okay and in the exam I will give you"
"11-09","10:45","some practice some um network with like the the numbers"
"11-09","10:51","okay uh for each link with the cost for each link and then you will need to fill in this table and also generate the"
"11-09","10:58","local forwarding table generate the short path tree okay or the list cost path three so those are"
"11-09","11:04","are very important so make sure you really understand that and then second algorithm is the"
"11-09","11:10","distance Vector album decent Vector algorithm is different from link State as we"
"11-09","11:16","mentioned before the state algorithm is a global algorithm which means each router actually know"
"11-09","11:24","the topology for this entire Network it knows the cost of"
"11-09","11:31","the cost between every two routers okay but additional Vector algorithm the"
"11-09","11:38","router know only the neighbors it doesn't care about others it only rely"
"11-09","11:45","on the neighbor's information to make the final decision okay so this number"
"11-09","11:50","to Amazon is based on the bellman4 equation so for this equation you can see if we Define dxy as the cost of"
"11-09","11:59","least cost path from X to Y okay so basically X is the sauce and Y is the"
"11-09","12:10","destination then in this case d x y equals 2 equal"
"11-09","12:17","to 1. so firstly c x y c x y is the cost between X and Y"
"11-09","12:25","so who is the way who we exactly the neighbor of X so we have X and we have a"
"11-09","12:32","number of neighbors so they are all called we okay so then basically"
"11-09","12:39","um foreign also has a"
"11-09","12:45","this this destination this is the sauce"
"11-09","12:50","as you can see the basically X will try different"
"11-09","12:56","neighbors different weights okay then for this way for example we know the"
"11-09","13:02","cost from way to Y to the destination Y is d y and then the cost between X and Y"
"11-09","13:09","is a c x b okay so now we use the neighbor's cost"
"11-09","13:14","plus the cost from neighbor to the destination this will be the total cost"
"11-09","13:20","for this part okay then basically X will try all the"
"11-09","13:26","neighbors try all the neighbors and then choose the minimum one okay so this is the base of this in the"
"11-09","13:34","vector algorithm now let's look at the example in this example we know uh d v z"
"11-09","13:41","is equal to 5 d x z equal to 3 d w z equal to third"
"11-09","13:49","okay these are our assumptions okay and then if we want to calculate"
"11-09","13:55","the short the least cost from U to Z then you will basically look at them the"
"11-09","14:03","different neighbors so U has a one neighbor another neighbor"
"11-09","14:08","a third neighbor k u has three neighbors so among these neighbors you will try different"
"11-09","14:15","neighbors so basically let's say we try the neighbor wave first we try neighbor"
"11-09","14:21","wave first and then we know the cost between you and me is two two"
"11-09","14:26","plus d raise it from way to Z we know it is 5."
"11-09","14:31","okay so 2 plus 5 that is 7. and then we also try X"
"11-09","14:37","number x x c u x is one okay and d x z we know this is third"
"11-09","14:44","okay so it's one plus three this is a four then for c u w okay we try neighbor w"
"11-09","14:53","then the cost between U and W is 5. cuw is 5 5 plus dwc from W to the"
"11-09","15:02","destination Z is uh three so five plus three equal to eight"
"11-09","15:08","okay the amount all these all of this we choose the smallest one which is four"
"11-09","15:14","this is how we calculate the shortest path from the source to the destination we"
"11-09","15:21","basically look at only the neighbors we do not care about the others okay and"
"11-09","15:27","you can see actually uh it is very important for the neighbors to provide accurate and correct information if the"
"11-09","15:35","neighbors do not provide the correct information then we cannot calculate this correctly"
"11-09","15:41","thank you and then um the decent Vector algorithm is basically every node maintaining a"
"11-09","15:48","distant vector okay and the error note one when when one of the notice something changes notice the cost"
"11-09","15:55","changes then this node will need to notify all the other neighbors say hey I"
"11-09","16:02","have workers change and you need to change your cost based on mine okay then"
"11-09","16:07","those neighbors cost will change and then they will need to update their"
"11-09","16:13","neighbors including than this neighbor okay so let's see the"
"11-09","16:20","um I maybe let's do this very quickly and I"
"11-09","16:27","don't want to um go very deep into this okay so for"
"11-09","16:32","example you can see for notes Here we have three notes X Y and Z okay note has"
"11-09","16:38","a table X okay so so node X has a table and this table is maintaining the cost"
"11-09","16:46","from F to x x y and easy white x white"
"11-09","16:52","white Z to ask Z2 yd today it is maintaining all the cost and node"
"11-09","16:59","Y is also maintaining uh its own cost okay so for this we call this as a"
"11-09","17:06","distance vector okay and then when we do initialization you can say from X to X the cost is zero"
"11-09","17:15","from X to Y the cost is from X to Y it because it's 2 from X to Z the cost is"
"11-09","17:22","seven okay for the others we just make it Infinity because we don't know yet and"
"11-09","17:30","then why we also do the uh initialization y to X is 2"
"11-09","17:36","okay y to Y is zero why today is a one"
"11-09","17:42","okay similarly from Z to X is seven Z to Y is one Z to Z is zero okay so"
"11-09","17:52","these are the this is the initialization step and then the next step is you can"
"11-09","17:57","see node Y and node Z"
"11-09","18:02","because they have because they all have their own costs right so they need to"
"11-09","18:09","tell ex about their cost okay because there are ex- neighbors so"
"11-09","18:15","then why and they need to update x and x need to recalculate the cost based on"
"11-09","18:23","the information from Y and Z so you can see basically Y is copying its own"
"11-09","18:28","decent Vector to X table okay so Y is"
"11-09","18:33","sending X and 10x to say hey my cost is 201 and Z is also sending in 710 okay"
"11-09","18:41","then the network important thing is that X need to calculate these two values"
"11-09","18:46","based on the information from y and z so how can X calculate"
"11-09","18:53","X will say okay might cause the two definitions"
"11-09","19:01","we real y as the destination okay"
"11-09","19:07","equals to here x has two neighbors right do you remember we will try all the"
"11-09","19:13","neighbors and from all these neighbors we choose uh the smallest value okay so"
"11-09","19:19","then basically X will try y first so basically c x y is this one okay plus"
"11-09","19:28","from y to Y because the definition we know is y okay the neighborhood this is"
"11-09","19:33","neighbor y the first Y is neighbor Y the second Y is the destination y"
"11-09","19:41","okay they have different meanings that's why it's actually the destination y"
"11-09","19:50","okay and then this is a try enable y if we try neighbor Z then it's c x z"
"11-09","19:59","plus d z y from Z to Y so d z y from"
"11-09","20:05","neighbor J to destination y okay"
"11-09","20:10","then from neighbor J to destination y again"
"11-09","20:15","this Z is actually neighbor and Y is the destination so then among this let's say"
"11-09","20:22","c x y equal to 2 2 plus d y from y to Y from White y we"
"11-09","20:30","need to refer to this table from y 2y so this is actually dyy"
"11-09","20:41","okay this number is dyy uh it's zero one is zero so two plus"
"11-09","20:47","zero is a two and c x z c x z we know from the figure we know this is seven"
"11-09","20:53","and then this is a this is a is actually from sorry DZ y from Z to y this is uh"
"11-09","21:03","actually d z y so you can see this is one so"
"11-09","21:09","seven plus one equals to eight among these two we choose the smallest number"
"11-09","21:14","which is two and then we will put two here okay so this is how we calculate dxy"
"11-09","21:21","similarly we can calculate DX Z XZ we will try different neighbors again"
"11-09","21:29","to enable y okay c x y plus from y to Z okay from y"
"11-09","21:36","to Z and c x Z Plus from Z to Z okay so the c x y we know this is 2 d y"
"11-09","21:46","z d y z is from y to Z so this value is actually d y z this is a one okay and"
"11-09","21:56","then c x y we know c x y is I'm sorry c x z is 7 6 7 and this is it"
"11-09","22:06","this is actually this one from Z to Z this is a d z z"
"11-09","22:12","okay so this is equals to um zero then we we know okay two plus"
"11-09","22:20","one equal to 3 7 plus 0 equals to seven so the minimum number is three then we"
"11-09","22:25","will update this number and put through here okay so and now you can see X has"
"11-09","22:32","updated its own value based on the information provided from y and z"
"11-09","22:37","similarly similarly as you can see"
"11-09","22:43","here x needs to send the information to Y they"
"11-09","22:49","need to send the information to y okay and X need to send the information"
"11-09","22:54","today why you need to send the information today"
"11-09","23:00","and then they will update this value so y opposite Y update"
"11-09","23:07","uh that's this value okay"
"11-09","23:12","so basically based on those information they will do calculations and then"
"11-09","23:18","okay then after that because X has already updated its own value it needs"
"11-09","23:26","to it needs to send the information again to Y and today"
"11-09","23:33","okay similarly if Y and Z also get new values they need to update the other"
"11-09","23:40","neighbors okay so you can see this is actually"
"11-09","23:47","um changing process it it needs to go on"
"11-09","23:54","and on until finally we reach some kind of equilibrium or some kind of a balance"
"11-09","24:01","okay and here finally all these values they do not change anymore okay so this"
"11-09","24:08","is the distance Vector algorithm and um"
"11-09","24:14","I don't require you I I want you to understand the basics of"
"11-09","24:19","what is the vectorism like for example the Spellman fourth equation and how we"
"11-09","24:25","can use to do calculations okay um I do not require you to know a of"
"11-09","24:34","course it's better if you know how to do the calculation but in the test I will not ask you to do such kind of uh"
"11-09","24:42","algorithm um running okay it's different from the"
"11-09","24:47","next details so don't worry about that part and this doesn't matter album has a"
"11-09","24:52","feature which is called good news travels fast bad news travels slow so"
"11-09","24:58","this means um basically if for example if uh cost"
"11-09","25:04","is changing to a smaller number okay we know because of this link cost"
"11-09","25:12","is changing so for example X will need to update all the neighbors say hey we"
"11-09","25:17","have a link cost here link cost changing here okay so then everybody need to update their own tables and it takes"
"11-09","25:24","only a few iterations to finally reach the equilibrium to finally"
"11-09","25:30","um guess uh guess the final value okay but if if this number is changing"
"11-09","25:38","from a small number to a much bigger number okay to a much bigger number then"
"11-09","25:46","basically this num this uh this uh this news Okay this this bad news will"
"11-09","25:55","take a lot of iterations before the algorithm finally established stabilize"
"11-09","26:02","okay so this is called the good news channel was fast and bad news travel"
"11-09","26:07","slow basically for if you increase learning cost to a much bigger number"
"11-09","26:13","then it takes a lot of iterations for the Amazon to stabilize to to"
"11-09","26:20","finally get the final value okay uh I don't want to urinate in the first"
"11-09","26:27","semester sometimes I explain this in details why but now I think uh we do not"
"11-09","26:32","have time to explain that in that detail and then you only need to remember the"
"11-09","26:39","final conclusion good news travels fast bad news travel slow okay you don't need to"
"11-09","26:44","explain why the bad news travels low"
"11-09","26:49","okay now let's compare the links this algorithm and distance Vector algorithm"
"11-09","26:55","for the message complexity the link State album has anodes e-links them"
"11-09","27:02","because we as we said all the routers need to know the state of the entire"
"11-09","27:08","network then that means we have to send at least a big O and E messages to"
"11-09","27:15","update everybody okay and for this adventure I was on the exchange it happens only between the"
"11-09","27:22","neighbors okay so for the speed of convergency for"
"11-09","27:29","LinkedIn outcome okay again"
"11-09","27:35","um the on2 algorithm requires o and E messages they need to exchange the"
"11-09","27:40","messages and as we said we may have oscillation problem postulation problem do you remember when"
"11-09","27:45","I said uh when you travel it will drive on the road okay you may want to choose"
"11-09","27:51","the one that is faster and after you change the name to the first to the"
"11-09","27:56","faster Lane you may finally realize the fastening is becoming slower that's because everybody is changing to the"
"11-09","28:03","faster Lane so now the fast training becomes slowly okay so then you can change back you change back and then"
"11-09","28:10","everybody is changing back okay so this it will generate the oscillation problem"
"11-09","28:16","for distance Vector the convergence in time convergency time may vary as you"
"11-09","28:23","can see sometimes if you are changing to changing the cost to a higher number it"
"11-09","28:29","takes longer to converge but if you are changing the cost to a smaller number it"
"11-09","28:35","takes shorter to converge okay so for robustness what happens if the"
"11-09","28:42","router malfunctions foreign the node can advertise incorrect"
"11-09","28:48","link cost okay each node will compute its own table"
"11-09","28:53","so they they are kind of in independent from each other because they are making"
"11-09","28:59","their own judgments okay but for this Vector algorithm the nodes can advertise"
"11-09","29:05","incorrect cost okay and the nodes are relying actually on the neighbors if the"
"11-09","29:12","neighbors are providing incorrect information then those routers will"
"11-09","29:17","generate the wrong results okay so those are their difference uh those are all about the different"
"11-09","29:24","albums as I said this nixteen album will be very important it may appear on the"
"11-09","29:30","test for this and out Vector algorithm you only need to know the BF equation how to use VF equation you don't need to"
"11-09","29:37","worry about running the algorithm in detail okay the next thing we want to discuss"
"11-09","29:45","is the hierarchical routine currently we what we have learned or for"
"11-09","29:52","other accounts or no matter is selling state or distance Vector it's kind of a"
"11-09","29:58","flat the network is kind of flat okay because we are treating all the rounders"
"11-09","30:03","as the same but this is not true in practice okay you think about this in reality we"
"11-09","30:10","may have we may have a lot of raptors we have a huge number of routers"
"11-09","30:17","we cannot treat those Rafters all the same okay we cannot store for example if"
"11-09","30:23","you are running State housing you cannot run this algorithm towards the entire"
"11-09","30:28","network you think about this because we have so many routers"
"11-09","30:34","um foreign State algorithm will require every router knowing the status of the"
"11-09","30:41","entire network knowing the topology knowing the link cost okay but if we are"
"11-09","30:47","training all the routers at the same can we store all the destinations information in the routing table we"
"11-09","30:54","cannot we cannot store all the information in just one router right the router has to be"
"11-09","30:59","has to have really huge uh storage space okay that is not possible"
"11-09","31:07","um and another thing you need to consider is internet in reality is a network of networks each Network admin"
"11-09","31:14","may want to control the royalty in its own network so for example sex state may"
"11-09","31:22","say Okay I want to control my own network I want to manage this in this way UCD may say I want to manage this in"
"11-09","31:29","a different way I want to run a different algorithm okay and different isps may want to control their Network"
"11-09","31:36","in different ways so that's why it's actually um we we call this as administrative"
"11-09","31:43","autonomy okay so because of that usually what we do is"
"11-09","31:51","aggregate the routers into regions for those regions each region we call it a"
"11-09","31:57","autonomous system and as okay the router in the same as run the same routine"
"11-09","32:05","protocol usually so for those kind of routing protocol we"
"11-09","32:11","call it as intro as routine protocol okay then the routers in different as"
"11-09","32:19","current different intro as routine protocols so for example we may have this as"
"11-09","32:27","another as another as we may have different as"
"11-09","32:33","okay then within each as we can run different routing algorithms"
"11-09","32:39","so for example this as may decide to run link States this as may decide to run a"
"11-09","32:45","decent Vector this is decided to running state I'm just giving an example of"
"11-09","32:51","course in reality we may have more complicated algorithm okay but anyway"
"11-09","32:57","each as may run its own routing algorithm and we also need to run"
"11-09","33:06","among those as so for example from this as1 to as2 to S3 so what is the shortest"
"11-09","33:15","path from as1 to sas3 what is the shortest path from as1 to as2"
"11-09","33:22","okay of course we have more ES"
"11-09","33:27","okay there are more here I'm just giving an example then among those as we also need to run some"
"11-09","33:35","routine algorithm to find the best way to reach a certain"
"11-09","33:42","autonomous system okay that is actually the uh external as"
"11-09","33:49","routine housing okay or we call it inter as routines so now"
"11-09","33:56","let's look at an example here okay so in this example you can say"
"11-09","34:03","um we are looking at a router 1D okay for Rounds from 1D the forwarding"
"11-09","34:11","table for 1D is actually determined by two things one thing is the intro as routine"
"11-09","34:19","algorithm another thing is the inter as routine Amazon"
"11-09","34:24","okay so the inter is routing algorithm actually determines"
"11-09","34:31","um the best way to reach a certain autonomous system okay then the intro answer optionalism"
"11-09","34:39","is determining the best way to reach a certain Gateway voucher okay so we're"
"11-09","34:45","explaining more later but anyway now you need to know you need to know the forwarding table is actually determined"
"11-09","34:51","not by just one routinism is actually by two types of Rockhampton inter and inter"
"11-09","34:58","okay so let's firstly look at the inter as tasks okay we suppose the rupturing is"
"11-09","35:06","one receive the desk that receives a datagram destined outside of ES1"
"11-09","35:13","then okay the router should forward the packet to the Gateway router by which"
"11-09","35:19","one okay we don't know for this package if it arrives at ES1"
"11-09","35:26","and we need to forward it to somebody else okay so for example if you want to"
"11-09","35:32","forward this to as2 then you should send this package to 1B because 1B is the"
"11-09","35:40","Gateway router that is connected to as2 okay"
"11-09","35:45","but if you are sending this package to as3 then you should send this package to"
"11-09","35:54","Gateway router 1C because 1C is the Gateway router connected to as3"
"11-09","36:00","okay so now basically as1 need to make this decision"
"11-09","36:05","okay so as one must learn which destinations are reachable through as2"
"11-09","36:11","which definitions are reachable through S3 okay and then as1 need to propagate this"
"11-09","36:21","reachability information to all the routers inside as1"
"11-09","36:29","so after basically after ESO one learns how to reach those destinations through"
"11-09","36:34","those um as okay then yes we need to tell all"
"11-09","36:41","the routers inside the S1 about this reachability information"
"11-09","36:46","okay because with this information then these routers can make their own decision they can run"
"11-09","36:53","render our routine algorithm right so you can see this job one two is uh the"
"11-09","36:59","job of inter as routine awesome okay so basically the inter as routing"
"11-09","37:07","algorithm need to learn which destinations are reachable through which autonomous systems"
"11-09","37:15","and then propagate this reachability information to all the routers inside"
"11-09","37:20","this autonomous system okay it's like it's like uh for example for"
"11-09","37:28","our class we have so many students if each student is a router okay"
"11-09","37:34","then for our class we need to learn if we want to reach some person"
"11-09","37:41","okay some other student in other classes we need to learn how we can"
"11-09","37:47","reach that person through which classes right so we may go through class one class two class three and finally reach"
"11-09","37:55","a person okay we need to learn those kind of information and then we need to come back tell everybody in our class"
"11-09","38:03","saying hey these are all the reachability information I have learned okay and then you need to you make your"
"11-09","38:11","judgments based on those information so that is the job of inter as routine"
"11-09","38:18","okay now we suppose as1 learns that"
"11-09","38:24","the subnet X is reachable through as3"
"11-09","38:31","okay but not through as2 and then this intra as protocol protocol"
"11-09","38:39","will propagate this reachability information to all the routers within ES1"
"11-09","38:45","okay then the router 1D determines"
"11-09","38:51","from the intro s algorithm okay it will it will firstly it will"
"11-09","38:57","know okay I need to send forward this packet to once it because 1C is connected to"
"11-09","39:07","as3 okay and we know as3 can reach X"
"11-09","39:13","okay then the next thing is the next thing 1D we will need to determine is"
"11-09","39:20","how can I reach this 1C okay what is the shortest path"
"11-09","39:27","or the least cost path to reach 1C okay this"
"11-09","39:34","is another algorithm this this algorithm is run is run with"
"11-09","39:40","aes1 so this is actually the intro as routine"
"11-09","39:45","okay this is interesting so basically now if we summarize if we summarize the"
"11-09","39:52","inter as routine is learning about the reachability information the as"
"11-09","39:58","reachability information and then broadcast appropriate the information to"
"11-09","40:03","all the routers inside this network then the intro is abstracting algorithm"
"11-09","40:09","is basically used to determine the shortest path from The Source router to"
"11-09","40:15","the Gateway launcher okay from 1D to 1C okay similarly let's see let's look at"
"11-09","40:21","this now we suppose the X so for example can be reached through"
"11-09","40:27","both a S3 and as2 okay now 1D has a package"
"11-09","40:34","okay so it can either forward to as2 or 4 or to as3"
"11-09","40:42","okay now we need to determine firstly we need"
"11-09","40:48","to determine firstly should the way forward to as2 or as3"
"11-09","40:54","that is the inter as routine part okay should we forward to es2 or as3"
"11-09","41:03","okay which means which is the the best as path"
"11-09","41:10","okay that is an intern es launching algorithm if finally we decide"
"11-09","41:17","for example we decide to forward to as2 okay then we will say Okay 1B is the"
"11-09","41:27","shortest it is the Gateway router that we should use then one thing we'll need"
"11-09","41:32","to determine what is the shortest path from 1D to 1B"
"11-09","41:38","okay so that is the intra as routine"
"11-09","41:44","now you can say when the package is destination as X"
"11-09","41:50","okay and the outgoing link the we are actually looking at the forwarding table"
"11-09","41:57","okay this is the destination if the definition is X then the outgoing"
"11-09","42:03","link should be let's see if this is a link one this is link two okay so this"
"11-09","42:08","outgoing link should be one why it's actually determined by two things"
"11-09","42:15","one thing is the interest rotioxide which helps determine the best as is to"
"11-09","42:22","go through as2 and after that we need to determine okay the best"
"11-09","42:29","um the shortest path to reach 1B to reach this Gateway is actually going"
"11-09","42:34","through link one okay so it's determined by two things inter yes and intro as okay so that is"
"11-09","42:43","the hierarchical routine and let's continue to discuss the"
"11-09","42:49","royalty in the real internet so what we have learned are just the principles the"
"11-09","42:54","like the basics for optionalism but what are really used in the internet we need"
"11-09","43:00","to look at that okay so firstly firstly"
"11-09","43:06","uh the intro is astronaut routine is also known as the inter interior Gateway"
"11-09","43:13","protocols okay IDP and the most common most commonly used"
"11-09","43:20","inter intro in astrological intro which means within this is okay"
"11-09","43:26","the most commonly used are ospf open shorted path first"
"11-09","43:32","igrp integrated with routing protocol so in our class we only introduce the first"
"11-09","43:39","one let's"
"11-14","0:03","let's continue to discuss the royalty in the real internet so what we have"
"11-14","0:08","learned are just the principles the like the basics for working hours but what"
"11-14","0:14","are really used in the internet we need to look at that okay so firstly firstly"
"11-14","0:22","uh the intro astronaut routine is also known as the inter interior Gateway"
"11-14","0:29","protocols okay IDP and the most common most commonly used"
"11-14","0:36","inter intro in astrological intro which means within this is okay"
"11-14","0:42","the most commonly used are ospf open shorted path first"
"11-14","0:48","igrp interrogate with routing protocol so in our class we only introduce the"
"11-14","0:54","first one ospf okay so ospf is opens publicly available it uses"
"11-14","1:03","an Institute algorithm okay um"
"11-14","1:09","and we all know that the topology need to be known as at each node okay the"
"11-14","1:15","Poly map is known as each node and we need to also do the package dissemination to tell to update all the"
"11-14","1:22","all the notes about the map okay and we also need to do the computation based on"
"11-14","1:27","the die construct algorithm okay and this ospf is actually also"
"11-14","1:34","hierarchical okay let's see for example we have this uh these are the back"
"11-14","1:40","boundary voucher this is connected to the internet okay these are the backbone"
"11-14","1:45","launchers and we also have the uh area border router so here we can see we have"
"11-14","1:50","different areas okay these are the internal routers and"
"11-14","1:56","then these are the area border routers these are the backbone launchers and"
"11-14","2:02","Boundary routers so we actually you can see this is a also hierarchical"
"11-14","2:08","okay the link State advertisement is is um download only with inner area Okay so"
"11-14","2:15","for example when we do the broadcasting sorry not working when we do um the link State algorithm we will look"
"11-14","2:22","at only this specific area okay and each note has detailed area topology"
"11-14","2:29","and then we also have the area border routers which summarize distance to the"
"11-14","2:35","to the Nets in own area and also other words is to other every body routers so"
"11-14","2:41","we also have the background backbone launchers which run ospf"
"11-14","2:48","within the backbone okay so um basically you can see the routine"
"11-14","2:56","album is actually run within each area and also within the backbone okay to"
"11-14","3:02","make the decision uh this that is the intro as routine for"
"11-14","3:07","inter as routine okay we call it BJP the full name is border"
"11-14","3:14","Gateway protocol okay so this is the internet"
"11-14","3:20","do you remember we said for internet routine exam it actually has a two"
"11-14","3:26","functionalities the first functionality is to learn the reachability information you remember I said if we are if I want"
"11-14","3:35","to send some letter or something to some other classes we need to learn the reachability information how should we"
"11-14","3:42","go through class one class three plus four or class two class one plus plus"
"11-14","3:47","five okay so we need to learn the reachability information as number one number two is after we learn this"
"11-14","3:54","reachability information we need to propagate that to all the people in our"
"11-14","4:00","class right so two functionalities similarly for bgp it's the same thing okay for bdp"
"11-14","4:08","may have ebgp and ibgp so the purpose for evgp is to obtain the"
"11-14","4:17","subnetic reachability information from the neighboring ES okay then after we learn the reusability"
"11-14","4:26","information we will need to use ibjp to propagate the reachability information"
"11-14","4:32","to all the as internal routers so optional learn the"
"11-14","4:38","visibility information come back tell everybody in our class it's like that"
"11-14","4:44","okay so that is ibgp um and then we need to determine the good routes to other networks based on"
"11-14","4:50","reachable information and the policy okay so this allows the subnet to"
"11-14","4:56","advertise its existence to the rest of the internet say I'm here okay now let's"
"11-14","5:01","look at the example for bgp session uh we have"
"11-14","5:09","we have two bdp routers exchanging the video messages so we need to advertise the parts to different destination"
"11-14","5:16","Network prefixes okay prefix I hope you still remember okay uh basically for IP address we know"
"11-14","5:24","it has prefix right we when we do the advertisement we need"
"11-14","5:29","that we tell others say hey if you have a letter going to California please send"
"11-14","5:34","it to me so we do this using IP address so we do slash 24 for example IP address"
"11-14","5:41","one two three four slash 24 24 the first 24 bits"
"11-14","5:47","I used for uh for um uh Network prefix okay so it's"
"11-14","5:55","like that of course you can change this 24 number 24 to some other numbers okay"
"11-14","6:01","so for example one bs3 and vertices are"
"11-14","6:07","prefix to as1 as3 promises it will forward the"
"11-14","6:13","datagram toward that prefix means when S3 is saying say hey if you have any"
"11-14","6:19","letter to California please forward to me basically Esther is making a promise if"
"11-14","6:26","you have a letter to California I will definitely forward that to California okay"
"11-14","6:32","and of course Esther will also aggregate the prefix in advertisement for example"
"11-14","6:37","if we have California and also um maybe Seattle okay it's not I mean I"
"11-14","6:45","mean circle is not a state but sometimes we do aggregation like that okay so if"
"11-14","6:51","you have any letter of going to California or Seattle give it to me okay so it's like like that so S3 can"
"11-14","6:58","aggregate the prefix in this advertisement and then okay we will use epgp session"
"11-14","7:06","between third a and 1C okay so as through will send this"
"11-14","7:14","reachability information to as1 by using e bgp because we know ebdp is"
"11-14","7:22","used to learn which stability information okay and then once say we"
"11-14","7:27","are then use the ibdp sessions to broadcast this info to send this"
"11-14","7:33","information or project this information to all the routers Within as1"
"11-14","7:41","okay then now one you can see one thing for"
"11-14","7:47","example can use the ibgp to distribute the the new prefix into all the routers"
"11-14","7:54","and 1B can then re-advertise the new reachability information to as2"
"11-14","8:01","through another ebgp session okay and similarly the 2A will do a ibap"
"11-14","8:11","session to propagate this information to all the routers Within as2 okay so this is the entire process you"
"11-14","8:18","can see we use EBT to learn the reachability information and then use ibdp to tell everybody within that yes"
"11-14","8:26","okay so then the path um so the adult type prefix include the bdp"
"11-14","8:33","attributes it includes um the prefix plus the attributes"
"11-14","8:39","okay so you may ask prefix if we understand this IP IP address prefixing and what are the attributes so there are"
"11-14","8:46","two very important attributes the first attribute is called as path aspath basically contains the as through which"
"11-14","8:54","prefix AdWords unit had passed so for example if on this part on this path we have passed the as67 as 17 then all"
"11-14","9:04","those as will be written on this okay this is the as we have go through for"
"11-14","9:12","this path okay and then the next the the the the second attribute is the next hop"
"11-14","9:18","next hub indicates the specific internal as router to next hub yes okay it's"
"11-14","9:25","basically telling this next hop information okay those Gateway vouchers"
"11-14","9:31","internal s routers um"
"11-14","9:37","so another thing you need to pay attention is the Gateway launcher receiving route"
"11-14","9:43","at Route advertisement uses some import policy to accept or decline okay and"
"11-14","9:50","when we make the decision about the routinalism we actually care a lot about the policy okay we call it policy based"
"11-14","9:58","routing so what does this mean this means this means policy is number"
"11-14","10:04","one important thing we need to consider when we determine the routing of the"
"11-14","10:10","routes in reality okay so it's not as of what you have already thought you may"
"11-14","10:16","even thought you may think oh four or a few of them as long as we can find the least cost path then we are fine but"
"11-14","10:22","that's not true okay in reality policy is the most important thing because"
"11-14","10:29","sometimes for example the isps may have competitions they may want they may"
"11-14","10:34","don't want to disclose some information to each other then for example even if"
"11-14","10:40","they know some shortest path they don't want to tell the other company that they have the shortest time okay or between"
"11-14","10:47","countries between um between different areas there are"
"11-14","10:53","also these kind of things so policy is always number one thing to consider when"
"11-14","10:58","you decide the best route and the next thing is to choose the shortest es path"
"11-14","11:06","okay the shot is a s path that means determine the a s path is actually more"
"11-14","11:13","important because um because as we can we can think about"
"11-14","11:18","this uh each path is more cost point right a s is more cost growing it's a"
"11-14","11:24","it's covering a larger area Okay so for example it's like if we want to make"
"11-14","11:30","this if we want to send a letter to somebody in another class we need to firstly determine which classes we need"
"11-14","11:37","to go go through which buildings we need to go through right because that is more"
"11-14","11:42","important and when you come to when you need to determine how to forward it"
"11-14","11:49","within a s that's not as important as the internet yes okay because the the"
"11-14","11:57","time Etc or the cost can be that can be saved"
"11-14","12:02","is is actually very small compared to the time or cost that you can see"
"11-14","12:08","um with me between the yes okay so then that's why the second thing is actually"
"11-14","12:15","the as path the third thing is the nest hop router so how you can how you can"
"11-14","12:22","find the closest Network router okay so this is actually VTE not es then we"
"11-14","12:30","consider some additional criteria so those are all the information for you"
"11-14","12:36","need to consider all the priorities you need to consider when we choose the best routes so you may you may think you may"
"11-14","12:43","ask uh why do um why does the bgp routing policy"
"11-14","12:48","matters okay why does the policy matters even more than performance sometimes"
"11-14","12:54","let's look an example here here A B and C are the provider networks okay X"
"11-14","13:05","w and y are customers so x w and y are"
"11-14","13:11","just no more users ABC are service providers like at T Comcast okay and as"
"11-14","13:18","you can see X is dual homes which means it belongs to both B and C it gets"
"11-14","13:26","services from both B and C okay so if your ex"
"11-14","13:32","if you are X will you let me uh or say no that"
"11-14","13:40","um you can reach the other party y or X"
"11-14","13:47","okay so X we are not l x we are not let B know that B can reach C through X"
"11-14","13:57","okay we know although there is a path between B and C here but X will not tell B about this path"
"11-14","14:05","why because if x help B about this path then we can assume the traffic from B"
"11-14","14:13","will be directed some of the traffic will be directed to X and then to C okay"
"11-14","14:19","so then X becomes a also a service provider right not service provider but"
"11-14","14:26","it's also excuse me it's also providing the"
"11-14","14:31","service for B but X is just a customer X is"
"11-14","14:37","paying to be for the service but it actually do not get does not get any pay"
"11-14","14:43","from B right so that's why X actually we are not advertised to be this route to C"
"11-14","14:52","okay that's one example another example is you can say a advertise the path aw"
"11-14","15:02","to B okay so a is basically telling B say hey"
"11-14","15:07","if you want to root W you can go through me and B will advertise the baw path"
"11-14","15:15","to X because X is a this customer so B will"
"11-14","15:20","say oh if you want to reach W you can go through me BAC okay but should be advert"
"11-14","15:28","height b a w path to C foreign"
"11-14","15:37","no way because what because BNC they are very likely competitors right at least the b"
"11-14","15:45","gets no revenue from C okay so b gets no revenue for routing"
"11-14","15:53","say b a w okay because C is not B's customer"
"11-14","16:01","okay um that's why we will not tell C about the"
"11-14","16:09","existence of this path okay if if B tells C then C will very likely direct"
"11-14","16:15","some traffic to baw okay so then in this case b will force C"
"11-14","16:22","to only route to W through a okay only right to W through a and"
"11-14","16:31","um because B wants to Route only two or from its own customers okay unless it"
"11-14","16:38","has two some of you may ask oh if one service provider does not pro does not"
"11-14","16:44","um advertise a path to the other service provider what if they are isolated what"
"11-14","16:50","if two two service providers are isolated and then they cannot reach each other"
"11-14","16:56","uh so you do you do not need to worry about this as we mentioned"
"11-14","17:01","if they are isolated okay then they must firstly cooperate"
"11-14","17:07","okay then they must firstly cooperate to make this internet work and then they"
"11-14","17:13","think about oh should I advertise this additional path or not"
"11-14","17:19","okay so at least this will make this internet work but from these examples you will say oh"
"11-14","17:25","policy do matter sometimes okay policy means here basically means"
"11-14","17:32","um should I advertise this path or not should I let my competitor know about"
"11-14","17:37","this or not okay so I think this is just one example okay and there are more"
"11-14","17:42","things to consider for example uh there may be some things among countries okay"
"11-14","17:48","you also need to consider that so um then"
"11-14","17:54","if you look at the inter and enter as routine okay so for intra as policy wise"
"11-14","18:01","policy wise for intern is the admin wants control over how is traffic"
"11-14","18:08","uh routed who robs the Recently is Network"
"11-14","18:13","okay so that's why we actually for interests we really need to consider"
"11-14","18:19","policy okay for intro as intro as because this"
"11-14","18:24","we have have only one admin okay it belongs to One Network so no policy"
"11-14","18:30","decision is needed no we do not need to consider any policy for intro as"
"11-14","18:37","uh if you consider the scale okay the hierarchical routine saves the"
"11-14","18:42","table size reduce reduce the update traffic okay because when we have hierarchical"
"11-14","18:51","routine we can do the routing within a small region we don't need to do the rocking uh for the entire network then"
"11-14","18:59","this can for sure see this table size okay performance wise for intro as it can"
"11-14","19:06","focus on only performance because it doesn't need to consider policy but for"
"11-14","19:12","enter es okay we need to follow uh for we need to firstly focus on policy and"
"11-14","19:19","then think about performance so policies May dominate over the performance okay"
"11-14","19:25","so those are the differences between ensure and interest rapping"
"11-14","19:32","so the last thing in this chapter is about broadcast in multicast and we we"
"11-14","19:39","will only talk about the broadcasting okay so what is broadcasting we have"
"11-14","19:44","mentioned before uh actually when we talk about the um for example DHCP okay we used"
"11-14","19:51","broadcasting so broadcasting basically means deliver the package from the source to all the other nodes"
"11-14","19:59","okay um and you can see because we want to deliver the package to all other nodes"
"11-14","20:06","we for sure we we will need to do some duplication right so you can say one way"
"11-14","20:12","to do the duplication is to do the duplication as a source so for example if R1 want to send all the package the"
"11-14","20:21","package to all the other nodes r2r3 and R4 then at R1 we can duplicate this"
"11-14","20:28","packet for three times and let's send this this through"
"11-14","20:33","duplications to uh R2 after right now four this is one way the other way is we"
"11-14","20:39","do a a network duplication that means so for example R1"
"11-14","20:46","uh we'll send it to R2 okay then R2 can duplicate and then send"
"11-14","20:52","it to R3 and R4 okay but actually for this kind of uh in"
"11-14","20:59","our duplication we have some problems the problem is that we may have flooding"
"11-14","21:04","happening you think about this so for example R1 send it to R2"
"11-14","21:10","okay R2 receives this wheel and the art will send this to R3 and R4 okay when R3"
"11-14","21:19","receives this after we will think oh okay I need to forward it to our"
"11-14","21:24","neighbor so Arthur will send it to R2 and also R4 okay similarly R4 will send it to R2 and"
"11-14","21:33","R3 okay then R2 will also think oh okay I"
"11-14","21:39","received two more packets one from author another one from R4 so R2 will"
"11-14","21:46","continue to broadcast again so it's never stop okay it never stops that's the problem"
"11-14","21:52","this for this problem we call it flooding okay to resolve this problem one way is"
"11-14","21:58","that we can do controlled flooding control variety basically means the node only broadcast the packets if it hasn't"
"11-14","22:07","broadcast the same package before okay for example if R2 receives this package"
"11-14","22:14","again from author and R4 the R2 will check and say oh okay I have already"
"11-14","22:19","broadcasted this package before so I don't need to broadcast it again so that"
"11-14","22:25","is uh how we do controlled flooding although control flooding is is effective but still you can see there"
"11-14","22:32","there is some actual work right so there is some redundant work for example uh"
"11-14","22:38","when R2 flooded to I mean send it to R3 and R4 author is sending to R4"
"11-14","22:46","okay and Alpha is sending it to author and they both sent the package to R2 so"
"11-14","22:53","those work are not necessary anymore why because author and Alpha have already"
"11-14","23:00","received a copy from R2 okay so as you can see"
"11-14","23:06","as again although controlled flooding can control the flooding but still we"
"11-14","23:12","have already done some redundant work okay so then people begin to think oh what is"
"11-14","23:19","a better way to do the broadcasting so a battery is using spanning tree"
"11-14","23:26","you feel spanning tree then no redundant packets can be received by any node okay"
"11-14","23:32","so what is a spanning tree for example now we have already constructed to uh"
"11-14","23:38","constructed one spanning tree okay if you follow this uh"
"11-14","23:43","both lines okay so this is a network and the Border"
"11-14","23:50","Lines has formed a monitoring okay and now if the broadcast is"
"11-14","23:58","initially at it at a that means if a is the source okay a can then send this"
"11-14","24:05","package following the spanning tree so that means a will send it to save"
"11-14","24:11","and also to be okay so see we are forwarded to F and E"
"11-14","24:19","but say we are not send it to B why because this link is not part of the"
"11-14","24:27","spanning tree okay and then B we are forward to D"
"11-14","24:33","again B will not send it to C because this is not part of the stem Spanish BC"
"11-14","24:40","is not part of the Spanish tree okay and when D received this D will 40 is"
"11-14","24:46","only 2G they will not forward this to e because"
"11-14","24:51","the link d e is not on the Spanish tree okay similarly when F and E receives the"
"11-14","24:59","packet they will stop there they will not forward the package to each other because the link between F and E is not"
"11-14","25:07","part of the spanning tree that is the broadcast initiative at a if"
"11-14","25:13","the broadcast is initiated at D we do the same thing okay we follow spanning"
"11-14","25:19","tree send it to the neighbors B and G not here and B will afford it to a"
"11-14","25:27","area forward to C and CVO forwarding to F and e but not too big"
"11-14","25:34","okay F and E will not send to each other okay so as you can see we only follow"
"11-14","25:41","the spanning tree to forward the package then in this case we will not have any"
"11-14","25:47","flooding and we don't need to worry about redundant package received by the node okay"
"11-14","25:53","and then you may ask how can we create a Spanish tree okay here we are using a"
"11-14","26:00","spanning tree directly but how can we create a spanning tree so"
"11-14","26:07","it's actually very easy first you need to choose a center node"
"11-14","26:12","and then each node each other node will send a unique const join message to to"
"11-14","26:20","the center node okay as you can see because this is unicast John message this is"
"11-14","26:27","assume we assume this message is sent to the center node but the message will be"
"11-14","26:33","forwarded okay trying to be forwarded to the to the center node however the message is"
"11-14","26:39","forwarded until it arrives at a note already belonging to the spanning tree"
"11-14","26:45","if it already if that nose already belongs to a spanning tree then we don't need to forward again"
"11-14","26:52","okay so you are probably still a little bit confused but let's look at an example then you will get that"
"11-14","26:58","in this example can we choose a center of E"
"11-14","27:04","okay Central we and then any node okay let's start with f f will send a uni cost draw a message"
"11-14","27:14","to the center node which is e okay you say hey can I join you email say yes for"
"11-14","27:20","sure you can join me okay then now um"
"11-14","27:26","e become part I have to become part of the Spanish tree okay then the other"
"11-14","27:33","another node let's see again any other note okay let's see now B is trying to"
"11-14","27:38","join e okay B is trying to join e b will send a message to e and this message is"
"11-14","27:46","forwarded to D first and then D for this match is 3."
"11-14","27:53","okay um so finally they reach the E and then"
"11-14","27:58","B d and d e become part of the Spanish"
"11-14","28:04","okay next one maybe a is trying to join a will say hey can I join you"
"11-14","28:11","okay so anyway I'll send the message okay of course a can send the message to"
"11-14","28:19","C okay and then C Will C can reach e in"
"11-14","28:24","any enemy okay but a may also send the message to b here in this example it is"
"11-14","28:30","sending the message to b and the B is already part of the spanning trip so should we forward the message again we"
"11-14","28:36","do not need okay then a is now part of the spanning tree we continue and you"
"11-14","28:43","can see C is asking to join and c is now part of the expanding tree and G is"
"11-14","28:49","asking to join and G reaches D so D is already part of the expanding tree so we"
"11-14","28:55","can stop then here now we have one constructed"
"11-14","29:00","spanning tree okay and pay attention the spending tree may"
"11-14","29:06","be very different if you for if you follow different orders or even if you"
"11-14","29:12","follow the same order sometimes because you make different decisions uh for forwarding then the Spanish tree"
"11-14","29:19","can be totally different for example even if we do we do the same let's say okay here I have a"
"11-14","29:26","B C d j"
"11-14","29:32","still we have E and F"
"11-14","29:44","okay we are looking at the same structure"
"11-14","29:56","foreign and now let's follow the same order let's see"
"11-14","30:01","um sorry let's follow the same order and see we"
"11-14","30:07","can generate this a different spanning tree okay"
"11-14","30:13","firstly let's see firstly uh let's see still do F okay F will join e"
"11-14","30:21","doing this okay the second one we can do B and we can do something else okay of"
"11-14","30:28","course we can do something else you don't need to to be but here I just want to show you even if you follow the same"
"11-14","30:34","order sometimes you can construct a totally different spanning tree okay so then B mail say okay can I join you"
"11-14","30:41","this message this message may be forwarded to D maybe 40 to a maybe"
"11-14","30:47","forward it to C because B has three neighbors okay let's assume now D is for"
"11-14","30:53","this message to C okay and same here for this message to"
"11-14","30:59","to e right or see me forward this message to F or even a"
"11-14","31:04","okay so let's assume now maybe C had forward this message to F"
"11-14","31:10","okay then now f is already part of the spanning tree so it doesn't need to continue anymore now b c f e are part of"
"11-14","31:19","the Spanish tree okay then the next one may be uh let's say a is trying to join"
"11-14","31:26","AMA for this message to either B or C because it has two neighbors so a for"
"11-14","31:32","example now we make a different decision a is trying to send this to c because C"
"11-14","31:37","is already part of the spanning tree okay so now we have uh we have a joining the this this tree"
"11-14","31:46","okay then the next one uh let's say maybe um maybe D is trying to join okay if D"
"11-14","31:55","is trying to join D can either join from uh the consonants message to e or B or g"
"11-14","32:03","whatever way okay so let's say maybe these for only these two e"
"11-14","32:08","okay of course it can also afford this to be okay so now D is a part and then J"
"11-14","32:17","for this 2D and then because D is the only neighbor for G so now you can see"
"11-14","32:24","the the Spanish entry we constructed is very different from the one constructed"
"11-14","32:29","in the slides before okay although they are different but"
"11-14","32:35","this this they are all spanning trees and they can all complete the task of"
"11-14","32:41","broadcasting without redundant packets okay so keep this in mind"
"11-14","32:47","spanning tree is not unique okay it's not unique you may have very different answers even for the same"
"11-14","32:54","network structure so this is all about this chapter we are"
"11-14","33:01","done with chapter four"
"11-16","0:06","for this chapter we will mainly discuss the the second lowest layer link layer"
"11-16","0:12","so we will try to understand the error detection correction at link layer we"
"11-16","0:19","will try to understand the multiple access uh indicator because multiple access is a is a very important problem"
"11-16","0:26","in nuclear okay we will also talk about the ad addressing for link layer"
"11-16","0:31","we also talk about the ethernet and vlans okay so those are all the things"
"11-16","0:37","we will discuss um the need for the link virtualization"
"11-16","0:42","this part we will not discuss okay this product we will skip um and this part the the data center"
"11-16","0:51","networking is 5.6 is it's a very quick thing so we can finish it very soon uh"
"11-16","0:57","5.7 is very important this video has this chapter this section basically summarize what we have learned from the"
"11-16","1:04","very beginning of this semester okay it's basically uh provides our overview"
"11-16","1:10","of all the layers tuning clear okay so using one scenario and then we want to"
"11-16","1:16","uh I really want you to understand this part okay so now let's first we look at the link"
"11-16","1:23","layer terminologies at link layer for the hosts and launchers we call them as"
"11-16","1:29","nodes okay the communication channels that connect the adjacent nodes along the"
"11-16","1:35","communication path we call them as links you are already very familiar with those right we have wider links Wireless links"
"11-16","1:43","and we may have the lines connecting uh the different devices right for the"
"11-16","1:50","layer 2 packet okay layer 2 packet we call it as a frame"
"11-16","1:55","okay if you recall what we have learned from the previous layer the application layer we call it a"
"11-16","2:03","message and then transport layer we call it a segment okay"
"11-16","2:08","um the network layer we call it a datagram link layer we call it a frame okay this Frame encapsulates the network"
"11-16","2:16","layer of this ground so basically um if you remember what we have learned"
"11-16","2:23","before okay so then a message is encapsulated"
"11-16","2:32","with a transport layer header when it comes to the network layer"
"11-16","2:41","we are adding Network layer header we call this as a datagram right"
"11-16","2:46","so this entire thing is called d this enticing is called segments okay"
"11-16","3:03","and then now we are adding one more layer one more header to the datagram"
"11-16","3:10","okay we call this as a frame"
"11-16","3:15","okay so and pay attention some of you may ask what is the difference between link layer and the network layer"
"11-16","3:22","pay attention Network layer is dealing with um the network"
"11-16","3:28","um so how I should say for example we are dealing with the source and the destination and we are I think we are"
"11-16","3:35","discussing what is the best path to reach a destination from The Source okay"
"11-16","3:41","so that we may choose different paths between the source and destination"
"11-16","3:46","link layer is different link layer do not care about the path the the shortest"
"11-16","3:53","path or whatever okay uh it has the responsibility of transferring the datagram from one node to the physically"
"11-16","4:02","adjacent node over a link that means it doesn't care about the path okay it only"
"11-16","4:10","cares about the neighbors so I only deal with how I can deliver this packet to my"
"11-16","4:16","neighbors to my physically additionals I do not care what is the shortest path what is the the best least cost path"
"11-16","4:24","okay so that is the major difference between uh the network layer and the"
"11-16","4:30","link layer okay um"
"11-16","4:35","so the datagram transferred by different links um different link types may use"
"11-16","4:42","different type of protocols okay for example the ethernet if you're we are using a wider links we we should use"
"11-16","4:49","ethernet as the protocol okay and then if we are using Wi-Fi we"
"11-16","4:55","may follow the 880211 protocol okay so then you can see"
"11-16","5:02","um on the same path from the social definition we may use different link"
"11-16","5:07","layer protocols determined depending on what kind of links are used"
"11-16","5:13","on that path okay and each link protocol provides different services"
"11-16","5:19","okay so if we use the transportation analogy if we are considering a trip"
"11-16","5:24","from Princeton to lazane uh then we may take for example limo from Princeton to"
"11-16","5:31","JFK okay to to the airport and from airport to to another location we may"
"11-16","5:38","use an airplane and from the other location to the nation when we was trained so then you can see we can take"
"11-16","5:45","different matters different uh travel or I should"
"11-16","5:51","say um Transportation modes okay so then in"
"11-16","5:57","this analogy the tourist is a datagram okay we have different com communication"
"11-16","6:04","links okay then the transport segment like from Princeton to JFK is one"
"11-16","6:09","segment different Transportation transport segments are different communication links then the"
"11-16","6:16","transportation Transportation mode is basically the link layer protocol okay"
"11-16","6:21","we for example we may take bus we may take a plane we may take three they are like different link layer protocols and"
"11-16","6:29","then the travel agent is actually the right calcium the routing"
"11-16","6:35","algorithm is telling you what is the least cost path okay what is the best"
"11-16","6:42","part but regarding one kind of uh Transportation method you are using it"
"11-16","6:49","is determined by the link layer okay so then now let's look at the link layer"
"11-16","6:57","surface Services okay for link layer basically what we do is uh as as I said"
"11-16","7:03","before we encapsulate the datagram into frame okay we add the link layer header"
"11-16","7:10","and trailer okay then we also need to deal with the channel access if this is"
"11-16","7:17","shared media so you think about this for example if you are using Wi-Fi okay then when we"
"11-16","7:23","have multiple devices sharing the same Wi-Fi okay we are sharing the air"
"11-16","7:29","basically then in this case we may have competitions between those devices they"
"11-16","7:34","may all want to send something okay but then how can we control the access problem okay who which one can access uh"
"11-16","7:43","the channel okay so that is uh that is uh diode"
"11-16","7:49","um by the link layer and then the Mac addresses a MAC address is used in frame"
"11-16","7:56","headers uh to identifying the source and destination address this is different"
"11-16","8:01","from the IP address okay so I think you have already heard about"
"11-16","8:07","Mac address and we will learn more about this okay um"
"11-16","8:12","and we also need to think about the reliable delivery between adjacent nodes we have learned something about this in"
"11-16","8:20","the transport layer but um we also need to consider this in the"
"11-16","8:25","link layer okay so unique layer if you are using for example some"
"11-16","8:30","um low bit error link then you don't need to consider a lot about the reliability especially if you are using"
"11-16","8:37","fiber for example we know fiber has very low bit error rate okay but if you are"
"11-16","8:45","using like Wireless links this has a this type of links has a very high error"
"11-16","8:52","reads then in this case we need to really consider how to ensure both the"
"11-16","8:58","link level reliability and the end to end reliability so you may think what are the difference"
"11-16","9:04","between link level reliability and end-to-end reliability so link level basically means we want to"
"11-16","9:10","collect correct errors as soon as possible okay so for example from one node to the neighbor"
"11-16","9:17","okay we want to know the error and correct it as soon as possible if you if"
"11-16","9:23","we do only end to end reliability then that means from source to the destination okay then this is a long way"
"11-16","9:31","from source to the destination in this case when we find the error it may be"
"11-16","9:36","too late already okay we have to go back to the source again to to send the feedback and so we maybe do resending"
"11-16","9:44","Etc so it's not as efficient as the link level reliability okay"
"11-16","9:49","that's the major difference um for link layer okay link layer may"
"11-16","9:56","also do the I mean the services we expect is it may also do flow control"
"11-16","10:02","which means the pacing between adjacent sending and receiving notes we don't want to overwhelm the receiving notes"
"11-16","10:09","okay and we may also want to do the error detection so the arrows may be caused by the"
"11-16","10:16","signal attenuation or Some Noise Okay the receiver can detect the presence of"
"11-16","10:23","errors and then provided feedback to the sender for real transformation or simply drop the frame"
"11-16","10:30","okay so some of the receivers can also do error correction okay which means we can"
"11-16","10:38","directly detect the errors and crack the bit errors on our own then in this case"
"11-16","10:43","we don't need to border the sender okay and um the communication can be half"
"11-16","10:49","duplexed or full duplex so with half duplex the nodes at both"
"11-16","10:54","ends of Link can transmit but not at the same time okay"
"11-16","11:00","so you may ask where is the link layer implemented it is actually implemented"
"11-16","11:06","in each and every host in something called the Nick card"
"11-16","11:12","okay or we call it the network adapter or network interface card"
"11-16","11:19","okay um so so for example the computers will"
"11-16","11:25","know it may have the ethernet card 80211 card okay so those those cards are"
"11-16","11:32","used the network adapter card are used to implement the link layer okay so this"
"11-16","11:38","is a this card is usually attached to the host the system to the computer"
"11-16","11:43","system bus okay it is actually a combination of the"
"11-16","11:49","hardware software and also the firmware as you can see here is the bus okay and then we have a CPU connected to"
"11-16","11:57","it and the memory connect to the bus also this uh network adapter card"
"11-16","12:02","connected to that okay and you can see uh for CPU it's it is uh"
"11-16","12:10","it involves several layers application layer to link layer and then the network"
"11-16","12:16","adapter card or the new card is only dealing with the physical layer and the link layer okay"
"11-16","12:24","so at the standing side and there's a new side when we receive a datagram from"
"11-16","12:29","the CPU okay from upper layer then we encapsulate this datagram in a frame"
"11-16","12:37","something called frame okay we also add the arrow checking bees okay the rdt the"
"11-16","12:45","flow control Etc and then this this gram is sent to the receiving host which is usually the"
"11-16","12:52","neighbor okay the receiving house will look for errors do rdt"
"11-16","12:59","um which is reliability transfer okay um and uh then extract the datagram and"
"11-16","13:06","pass this datagram to the up layer at the receiving side so you can see this diagram is finally"
"11-16","13:12","passed it to the app layer for uh more um actions okay so this is a uh the link"
"11-16","13:21","layer the basics for link layer and 5.2 is about error detection and"
"11-16","13:28","correction as I mentioned uh error detection and correction is a very important part in nuclear actually"
"11-16","13:34","so for Arrow detection and correction we usually have some beats in the frame"
"11-16","13:44","okay for those pieces we call them as Ed saybs keep this in mind"
"11-16","13:50","EDC bits okay those adcbs are usually attached to"
"11-16","13:57","the datagram for error detection and correction okay"
"11-16","14:02","so for example here we have the data we have a datagram"
"11-16","14:08","okay and we have the data which is represented with d"
"11-16","14:14","and then EDC the error detection and the correction bits are attached"
"11-16","14:20","to the data okay then this entire thing is sent"
"11-16","14:26","through a bit Arrow prone link then later when the receiver side"
"11-16","14:32","received this okay it will have the D Prime and EDC Prime"
"11-16","14:38","so then it will use the EDC bits to check if all the bits in the D"
"11-16","14:46","Prime is okay if it is okay no arrows are detected"
"11-16","14:52","then this datagram will be passed to up layer but if this is not okay if we"
"11-16","14:58","detect some errors then we will take some other action for example we may notify the sender to resend it again or"
"11-16","15:06","we may drop the frame okay so let's now look at a very simple"
"11-16","15:13","example this very simple example is uh the single bit parity okay so character"
"11-16","15:21","checking is actually very easy way to do the error attacking and the detection"
"11-16","15:26","although it's not very reliable but still it's one way okay so now you can"
"11-16","15:31","see we have data this is a the D part"
"11-16","15:41","and this is the EDC part okay we can do for example all the bits old parity"
"11-16","15:48","checking or even purchase hacking okay so if we do all the party checking"
"11-16","15:54","okay uh we can say okay the number of ones should be an odd number"
"11-16","16:01","of ones should be old number you can count for example one two three four"
"11-16","16:07","five six seven eight nine okay this is uh odd number nine is odd"
"11-16","16:14","number then in this case we do we for the bit party uh bit or the EDC bit we put zero"
"11-16","16:23","now the total number of ones is 9 is old number"
"11-16","16:29","okay so if we are doing even project checking then we will need to make the"
"11-16","16:35","number of ones a even number so if we are doing the same data"
"11-16","16:41","this is odd if the same data"
"11-16","16:47","then here the party beat should be one okay to make the number of ones as even"
"11-16","16:55","number okay then for single bit part checking we can detect the arrows very easily so"
"11-16","17:03","for example if one day you you notice this number one is chained to zero okay"
"11-16","17:08","if you count number ones it is a eight number one is it is a even number"
"11-16","17:15","then you can easily tell oh there is error in the data because the number of ones is an even number"
"11-16","17:22","what we are doing now is actually odd part checking okay we are looking at the"
"11-16","17:27","old parachute you know the even parallel checking this is how you can detect the errors but sometimes this single bit"
"11-16","17:34","part checking may not work because what especially if you have two"
"11-16","17:41","or all number or even number of bits flipping at the same time for example if"
"11-16","17:47","you have this one flipped to zero and also this one click"
"11-16","17:52","to zero Okay then if you count the number ones now it's seven seven is an odd number so"
"11-16","18:00","it is uh uh you may think oh there's no error but actually we have two bits of"
"11-16","18:06","error okay that is the problem um"
"11-16","18:12","and you can also do a two-dimensional error two-dimensional bit priority"
"11-16","18:18","checking so if you do two dimensional basically you are you are doing the"
"11-16","18:24","price checking in both the rows and the columns for example now"
"11-16","18:29","you can say we are doing this is doing actually even project checking okay so"
"11-16","18:34","you can say uh this this is the data one zero one zero one is the data they are"
"11-16","18:40","all this data okay and then if you count number of ones for each row you have one"
"11-16","18:46","two three four so if fortunate for data you have only one two three ones this is"
"11-16","18:51","all the number so that's why we put one here and this is one two three four so we"
"11-16","18:57","have four ones so we put zero here and you have one two three this is uh"
"11-16","19:04","uh all number again so you put one here so if you look at each column"
"11-16","19:10","each column the one two okay or the uh even number we put zero one two we put"
"11-16","19:16","zero one two three odd number we put one to make it even and one two zero okay one two uh sorry"
"11-16","19:27","one so we add one to make it even so this is how we uh do the beat party"
"11-16","19:34","uh in two-dimensional okay we put the data into rows and then we do the price"
"11-16","19:41","checking for each for all the rows and the uh columns okay if we have something"
"11-16","19:46","wrong okay so for example if this is this bit flipped to zero then you can easily"
"11-16","19:53","detect the error because when you count the numbers you can see one two three four this is fine even one two three"
"11-16","20:00","this column has a problem because this is odd okay and then one two three four"
"11-16","20:06","sorry this row has a problem okay this row has no problem one two three four is"
"11-16","20:12","even this row is fine then we look at each columns so one two even is fine one"
"11-16","20:18","this is uh not even this is odd so we see this column has a problem"
"11-16","20:24","and then one two three four even one two even one two even okay so finally then"
"11-16","20:30","you can see oh we are able to find out the beat the arrow bit okay so we know"
"11-16","20:36","this error this bit has Arrow why because it this speed should belong to this row"
"11-16","20:42","and this column then now we can do error correction directly we can change this 0 to 1. This"
"11-16","20:50","Is How We Do Arrow correction okay um of course again this may not be"
"11-16","20:56","reliable especially when you have more piece flipping at the same time okay"
"11-16","21:03","then you may not be able to detect arrows and crack the errors no matter single pair checking or two-dimensional"
"11-16","21:10","preparing checking they they both have problems"
"11-16","21:15","um the problem is that when we have multiple multiple bits flipping at the same time then uh the bit parent"
"11-16","21:23","checking may not work very well okay and they may not be reliable for single"
"11-16","21:29","apparently single people chain for example if you have two bits or four bits or eight or any even number of"
"11-16","21:36","Beats sleeping at the same time then you cannot detect the errors right uh"
"11-16","21:43","similar for a two-dimensional beat party checking for two-dimensional B parachuting sometimes you if you have to"
"11-16","21:49","be sleeping at the same time then uh you cannot detect errors for that"
"11-16","21:57","specific column or specific row okay so before we have also learned another"
"11-16","22:04","different way of error checking I think you still remember it's called checksum"
"11-16","22:09","right so the goal of checksum is also to tell the errors in the transmitted"
"11-16","22:15","packet um so checksum is usually used at the"
"11-16","22:20","transport layer okay basically the center will change the segment contents"
"11-16","22:26","as a sequence of 16 beat integers then we check that we add"
"11-16","22:32","those um 16-bit integers together to calculate"
"11-16","22:38","to check them and then sender will put this checksum value into a checksum field the receiver will when the"
"11-16","22:46","receiver received the checks and the receiver will basically um check and we'll do the same same"
"11-16","22:53","computation following the way that Sandra has used Okay then if"
"11-16","22:59","um receiver can get the same results we said no error okay if if"
"11-16","23:04","um the there are some differences between the checksum from sender and the"
"11-16","23:11","checksum calculated by the receiver then we say oh there is a error detected okay"
"11-16","23:17","so that is the checksum and then for a link layer okay for link layer"
"11-16","23:25","a more powerful way to do error detection is using the psycholic"
"11-16","23:32","redundancy checking so this is more much much more reliable than the one we"
"11-16","23:40","learned before the beat parity checking okay um so generally if you look at the uh"
"11-16","23:47","CDC okay cyclic through dentist check it's the same thing we still firstly we"
"11-16","23:53","need to have data okay and then we need to have the um"
"11-16","23:59","aerobics so here data you can see uh it's it's it is represented with d okay"
"11-16","24:05","uh we so for example we may have DB so small D small D beats of data to be sent"
"11-16","24:12","okay and then uh for the CRC bits okay"
"11-16","24:18","it is uh represented with the capital r so the CRC bits are the cyclic redness"
"11-16","24:25","check Beats okay so you may have a small arbits of crcps okay so anyway you can"
"11-16","24:33","see it's still composed of both data and the EDC bits okay do you still remember"
"11-16","24:40","the error so here you can see uh this is like the general principle for error"
"11-16","24:46","detection right for Arrow detection we firstly we have the data and then we"
"11-16","24:51","have the error detection and correction bits EDC bits okay then this this entire"
"11-16","24:59","thing will be sent through the bit error prone link we get D Prime and EDC Prime then we"
"11-16","25:05","have some way to verify if the data is fine or not okay"
"11-16","25:11","so then in Heritage hacking um method the part the the adcbs are"
"11-16","25:18","just the disparity bits so very easy then for the cyclic redundance check"
"11-16","25:25","method the EDC beats are those CRC bits those Capital R's okay"
"11-16","25:33","so now we we can view the data"
"11-16","25:38","we can view the database d as a binary number okay"
"11-16","25:44","um then you may ask how can we choose the crcps how can we determine these RC bits okay"
"11-16","25:52","so let's look at this we need to before"
"11-16","25:57","we need to determine the r capital we need to firstly choose something called"
"11-16","26:03","generator G okay this G is is more R plus one bit"
"11-16","26:11","okay that means if your error checking and detection Beats"
"11-16","26:17","has small RBS then the generator has one more bit"
"11-16","26:22","so if this is more or equal to third then the generator has four bits okay so"
"11-16","26:28","what is this generator used for this generator is shared by the sender"
"11-16","26:34","and the receiver okay so basically the center will choose"
"11-16","26:40","um small r small rcrc bits okay and then determine this is a Big R"
"11-16","26:49","use that to determine the uh Big R okay so sorry basically sorry again so um"
"11-16","26:57","basically the sender and the receiver will use this G to calculate this R okay"
"11-16","27:05","their relationship is that g has one more bit than the Big R"
"11-16","27:12","okay so now the goal for the CRC is that"
"11-16","27:17","we need to choose our small r CBS which we need to choose a"
"11-16","27:24","Big R okay so that this entire thing this data"
"11-16","27:31","Plus this Big R can be divided by Big G"
"11-16","27:40","okay so it's it's a how should I say it's a actually it's a um very"
"11-16","27:46","straightforward thing okay generally what we need to do is we need to choose a generator G this generator is shared"
"11-16","27:55","by the sender and the receiver at the same time okay so the sender will use this J"
"11-16","28:03","generator to determine these are"
"11-16","28:08","okay and make sure this entire thing"
"11-16","28:14","is divided by can be divided by generator"
"11-16","28:20","okay and it has a no remainder okay then when the sender then then the"
"11-16","28:27","sender will send this entire thing D plus r to the receiver when the receiver"
"11-16","28:35","receives this entire packet the receiver will verify by doing this entire thing"
"11-16","28:43","divided by the generator because we I just told you the generator is shared by"
"11-16","28:48","the Central and receiver right so receiver also know the generator then the receiver will"
"11-16","28:54","use this entire thing to divide by the generator if there is no remainder"
"11-16","29:00","okay if there is no remainder or at the remainder sorry I should say the remainder is zero okay then that means"
"11-16","29:09","no error is detected but if the remainder is not zero then we"
"11-16","29:15","say the error is directed or detected okay so this is the CRC algorithm"
"11-16","29:23","um then how can we how can we represent this entire thing okay so in binary in"
"11-16","29:31","binary if you want to represent this entire thing what you need to do is D"
"11-16","29:37","times 2 because this is binary so D times 2 2 R because we have RBS xor is"
"11-16","29:46","like the plus okay it's like e um in"
"11-16","29:51","decimals like plus so because we learned we learned"
"11-16","29:56","um for example 0xor 0 equals to"
"11-16","30:01","uh zero one xor one equal to zero right"
"11-16","30:10","so uh zero X over one equal to one"
"11-16","30:19","One X over zero equals to one so you can see"
"11-16","30:25","um it's like decimal plus okay it's like decimal Plus in in binary so for example"
"11-16","30:31","in decimal we can say"
"11-16","30:48","so this number this number in this entire number this entire number we call"
"11-16","30:53","it 68 543 right so now if we represent this if"
"11-16","31:00","this is a two bits this is three bits"
"11-16","31:08","okay so what we can do is we can use if we want to represent this number we"
"11-16","31:14","can use 685 times 10 to"
"11-16","31:20","2 Okay Plus 43."
"11-16","31:25","okay 685 times 10 to 2 plus 43. then we can"
"11-16","31:32","represent this entire number with a formula like this okay so it's"
"11-16","31:37","this is the same thing in binary we can use this"
"11-16","31:42","d times 2 2R okay here if R equals 2 this is 2 to 2"
"11-16","31:49","if r equal to 3 is 2 to 3. xor the"
"11-16","31:54","uh the r okay so this is the mathematical formula then as we said as we said our goal is"
"11-16","32:03","that this entire thing this entire thing can be divided by a"
"11-16","32:10","generator J okay so we want this entire thing"
"11-16","32:17","to be divided by a generator J okay so it's a n times J"
"11-16","32:26","then this is equivalent to D times 2 to r equal to n g x o r r so"
"11-16","32:36","basically we can remove we can move this to the right"
"11-16","32:41","okay so that's because we know for xor is where X has a very interesting"
"11-16","32:46","feature that is foreign"
"11-16","33:10","okay so that's why we can do we can do um the second formula here"
"11-16","33:17","okay but basically move the x or R to the right and this second formula is"
"11-16","33:23","also equivalent two this"
"11-16","33:30","okay that means if we if that means we can do white"
"11-16","33:36","this D times 2 to R by G"
"11-16","33:42","okay and then the remainder is r"
"11-16","33:48","okay then the remainder is R so you may also why do you do this because you think about this our goal our goal is to"
"11-16","33:56","make this entire thing can be divided by J okay so our goal is that we want to"
"11-16","34:03","choose a Big R we want to choose the EDC bits or crcps"
"11-16","34:10","so that this entire d and r package can be divided by the generator"
"11-16","34:18","J okay so then how can we calculate this r we can calculate this R use this method"
"11-16","34:26","okay use this formula D times 2 to r divided by G and we get the remainder"
"11-16","34:33","okay so for example let's look at the example on the right now we have data one zero"
"11-16","34:40","one one one zero this is the data and we know"
"11-16","34:48","R equals to thirds more r equal to third that means here"
"11-16","34:53","here we have three bits and the arrow bits okay Arrow checking and detection bits"
"11-16","34:58","we have three bits so now what we do is we use d"
"11-16","35:05","times 2 to R okay that's basically means okay we use D and we add three zeros"
"11-16","35:12","that is two to R right then this entire thing is divided by G"
"11-16","35:19","okay this J here the J is chosen randomly by the center and receiver"
"11-16","35:25","okay so then we use this entire thing to divide by J and then when we get the"
"11-16","35:31","remainder the remainder is R okay so how do we do calculation in binary we'll do"
"11-16","35:37","the calculation like this so we we get one and one we get one zero"
"11-16","35:43","zero one here we do the xor okay binary so One X over one is zero One X or a"
"11-16","35:51","zero equal to one so we have one zero one and then we have the zero falling"
"11-16","35:56","down okay um"
"11-16","36:03","let's see yeah one oh wait for story We unfortunately have one following though we personally have one following down"
"11-16","36:10","and then we do zero here we have zero zero zero okay"
"11-16","36:15","then now we do X or again at Y X or a zero equal to one"
"11-16","36:21","one x o r zero equal to one that's zero X or zero equal to zero okay then this"
"11-16","36:30","zero now can fall fall down okay then we do we can do one"
"11-16","36:35","so then we have one zero zero one now we do X over again"
"11-16","36:41","you can see Zero X over one is one One X or zero is one then we have one one and"
"11-16","36:49","then zero following down so we continue until we finish the division now we get"
"11-16","36:56","X we can we get this zero one one so then these three bits"
"11-16","37:02","are the Arby's okay are the arrow detection and checking bits okay"
"11-16","37:09","so that basically means"
"11-16","37:15","originally for the data the data is this"
"11-16","37:24","one zero one one one"
"11-16","37:29","zero okay this is the data and then we need to calculate the r how"
"11-16","37:36","do we calculate that we use D times 2 to R okay divided by the generator J the"
"11-16","37:44","generator is a real generator is used to generate the remainder so then we get the remainder of 0 1 1"
"11-16","37:52","okay then this is a remainder 0 1 1 is the r then now the center will Ascend this"
"11-16","37:59","entire thing to the receiver the receiver will use one zero one one one zero zero one one"
"11-16","38:06","to divide to be divided by the generator J one zero zero one"
"11-16","38:12","if there is no remainder no error if there is a remainder zero a non-zero"
"11-16","38:18","remainder then we see there is error okay so that is how CRC is used I know"
"11-16","38:24","it's a bit uh complicated um so if you do not understand how this is"
"11-16","38:32","calculated it's totally fine but I want you to understand how this R is is"
"11-16","38:40","calculated okay so I want you to understand the left part the right part"
"11-16","38:46","is fine okay any questions"
"11-18","0:08","all right okay so the next part is the multiple access protocols"
"11-18","0:14","multiple access protocols is a very important part in this chapter and we we"
"11-18","0:21","will look at that so um"
"11-18","0:26","we we usually have two type of links in link layer one type is called the point"
"11-18","0:33","to point link okay point to point link um it's like it's like the telephone line"
"11-18","0:41","between two people so this is not shared to anybody not shared with anybody so"
"11-18","0:47","then this is like a reserved okay you don't need to consider about the sharing part but the second type of link is is"
"11-18","0:55","the sh is uh the shared type of Link or we call it broadcast type of Link okay"
"11-18","1:02","so this is used a lot actually for example we may use this in the ethernet"
"11-18","1:09","in the old style internet okay um although now we do not use it very"
"11-18","1:16","often but you can see this problem indeed exists before okay also for wireless okay we may also"
"11-18","1:26","have different devices sharing the same media basically the air right sharing"
"11-18","1:32","the same media to um commute and we may also have the satellites"
"11-18","1:38","okay um the different base stations sharing the also the space okay to communicate"
"11-18","1:46","with the satellite so this kind of sharing is like a people staying in the"
"11-18","1:52","same room for a party or whatever okay we are sharing the air okay so everybody"
"11-18","1:59","want to say something everyone probably want to send out a message okay then in"
"11-18","2:05","this case we may have the competition problem okay if everybody is saying something"
"11-18","2:11","can we hear each other clearly we cannot okay so that is called the multiple"
"11-18","2:16","access problem that means when they are sharing the same media"
"11-18","2:21","how do we ensure the quality of communication"
"11-18","2:27","so if we have a single shared broadcast channel and we have two or more simultaneous"
"11-18","2:35","transmissions by the nodes okay that means if we have nodes who want to communicate at the same time"
"11-18","2:43","then we may have interference okay so sometimes one note may receive"
"11-18","2:51","two or more signals at the same time then this is called clear"
"11-18","2:56","it's like when you are standing in a party you you are listening you may receiving"
"11-18","3:03","you may hearing two people saying something at the same time"
"11-18","3:10","then in this case your you you can you may not be able to process the the"
"11-18","3:15","information okay it's the same thing if one node receives two or more signals at the same"
"11-18","3:22","time then this is a calculator okay so then in this case we need to"
"11-18","3:28","have some kind of protocol called multiple access protocol okay multibox says protocol is a kind of"
"11-18","3:35","distributed algorithm that is used to determine how the nodes can share the"
"11-18","3:40","channel okay basically it's like um if we are in a party then we can say"
"11-18","3:47","oh each time everyone uh each time we can have only one person saying"
"11-18","3:54","something okay if you want to say something you need to raise your hand it's like in a"
"11-18","4:00","classroom for example okay so this kind of album is called the multiplicious"
"11-18","4:05","protocol is used to to control the communication um in the in one channel okay so the"
"11-18","4:14","communication about the channel sharing must use the channel itself okay"
"11-18","4:20","um so we do not have like another channel for coordination we do not have another"
"11-18","4:26","Channel say oh okay we use another channel to coordinate and then use this channel to communicate it's not possible"
"11-18","4:33","so basically including the even for the channel"
"11-18","4:38","sharing the communication about Channel sharing itself also need to use the channel okay also"
"11-18","4:45","used to use the channel itself um so then what is an ideal multiple"
"11-18","4:52","access protocol our dla our dla we if we have a"
"11-18","4:58","broadcast channel of read r rbps beats per second okay so then the"
"11-18","5:05","ideal situation is that firstly well one node wants to transmit"
"11-18","5:12","okay if only one node wants to transmit then of course it can send attribute r"
"11-18","5:18","that means it can utilize the maximum rate okay do whatever he or she wants to do"
"11-18","5:24","okay so one but when we have M nodes"
"11-18","5:30","who all wants to transmit then in this case each note can send at"
"11-18","5:36","an average rate of r divided by m okay that's that means we share"
"11-18","5:41","okay and also we want this multiple access"
"11-18","5:47","protocol to be fully decentralized that means we do not need any special node to"
"11-18","5:53","code in the Transmissions okay because if we have some node to coordinate then"
"11-18","5:58","we may have like single point of failure if this node is down then this entire algorithm cannot work okay uh the second"
"11-18","6:06","thing is we do not need any synchronization or clocks or slots or Etc because we we all know"
"11-18","6:12","synchronization is actually very difficult okay and then the fourth Sim"
"11-18","6:19","criteria is that this protocol should be very simple so these are the like what we are"
"11-18","6:29","expecting for the protocol what we hope that we can help right but in reality in"
"11-18","6:35","reality we may face some problems okay um generally we have three broad classes"
"11-18","6:42","of uh Mac protocols multiprocess protocols"
"11-18","6:48","um so first type is called Channel petitioning we actually learned about this before uh Channel partitioning"
"11-18","6:55","basically means we can divide the channel into smaller pieces in terms of"
"11-18","7:02","time or frequency or code Etc okay"
"11-18","7:07","um so for example before we learned fdma"
"11-18","7:17","tdma okay so those are all China Channel partitioning protocols and the second"
"11-18","7:23","type of protocol are called Random Access protocol So Random Access means the channel is"
"11-18","7:31","not divided and we like we may allow clearance happening okay the thing is when we have"
"11-18","7:38","clearance how can we recover from clearance that's the most important thing"
"11-18","7:44","the third type is called taking turns taking turns basically means the notes"
"11-18","7:49","take turns but knows with more to send can take longer turns okay so those are"
"11-18","7:56","the three types and now we want to look at each type okay so the first type as I"
"11-18","8:02","said tdma tdma is the time division multiple access okay so we need to"
"11-18","8:09","divide the time into um into different time slots demanded"
"11-18","8:16","yes divide the time into different time slots then basically the nodes can access to the channel in runs it's like"
"11-18","8:24","runs okay so each station gets a fixed length of slot in each round"
"11-18","8:32","um so for example now we can divide this into six"
"11-18","8:38","slots for six notes or six stations okay then for example station one will"
"11-18","8:45","use the first time slot station two will do the second time slot as you can see"
"11-18","8:50","if we have one station who doesn't want to send anything then"
"11-18","8:57","the time slots dedicated to that station will go idle"
"11-18","9:03","okay so basically means I use slots go either"
"11-18","9:08","um so the problem is that we may have for example here we have one three and a"
"11-18","9:14","four sending the packets but slots two five six are idle okay so this in this"
"11-18","9:20","case where as you learned before we may have the waste of time okay and similar"
"11-18","9:25","things for fdma for fdma it means frequency division multiplexes we do one"
"11-18","9:32","channel into different frequencies okay"
"11-18","9:38","and then for example if we have six channels we have six stations we can"
"11-18","9:44","have six channels okay or even more okay"
"11-18","9:49","um but anyway again uh now you can see this uh station one may use"
"11-18","9:57","this frequency station through music this one station four moves this one okay again there may be some"
"11-18","10:07","um frequencies that goes idle frequency bands go idle okay so that is fdma"
"11-18","10:17","um that's the first type called Channel partitioning the second type is called Random Access protocol"
"11-18","10:26","so in random access protocol um when the nodes wants to send a"
"11-18","10:34","package then it can directly send it out at a full read r"
"11-18","10:39","okay there is no like coordination among the notes"
"11-18","10:44","um when we have two or more nodes transmitting at the same time"
"11-18","10:50","okay that'll cause a node may receive the receiver may receive like multiple"
"11-18","10:55","signals at the same time then in this case we have clearance okay so basically the random access Mac"
"11-18","11:02","protocols will need to specify how to detect the clearance and how to"
"11-18","11:09","recover from clearance so these are some of the examples for"
"11-18","11:15","Mac protocols for Random Access Mac protocols so lots of the aloha aloha"
"11-18","11:21","um csma csma CD and csmsa so then we will look at this okay so the first"
"11-18","11:28","thing let's look at the slotted aloha for slot in the Aloha we assume all the"
"11-18","11:35","frames have the same size L bits okay and then we divide the time into equal"
"11-18","11:43","side slots so pay attention here although we are also dividing the time but this is no"
"11-18","11:49","time not time division it's it is different okay later if I learned"
"11-18","11:54","um so generally we divide the time into equal size slots each slot is L over R"
"11-18","12:02","seconds I think you are very familiar with this Lor right so what is this this is a this"
"11-18","12:08","is the transmission delay right so that means if we have LPS okay"
"11-18","12:14","then this can be divided by uh the transmission rate R okay then for one"
"11-18","12:21","packet if we want to fully Center this out fully push this out to the link it"
"11-18","12:27","takes air over our seconds okay so we will divide the time"
"11-18","12:33","equally each time slot is Lor and then we have a requirement"
"11-18","12:40","the requirement is that if a node wants to transmit"
"11-18","12:46","a package that knows the node has to start only at the slot beginning"
"11-18","12:54","okay the nodes are those nodes are also synchronized only start at a slot"
"11-18","13:00","beginning means you cannot simply start in the middle of a slot okay so if we"
"11-18","13:06","have two or more nodes transmit in the slots then all the nodes can detect the delay clear so then the operation is"
"11-18","13:13","like this when we when the node obtains a fresh frame then this node will need to wait until"
"11-18","13:22","the beginning of the next slot there's no cleaning then the node can send the"
"11-18","13:29","new frame in the next slot if there is clearance the node will need to"
"11-18","13:35","re-transmit this frame in each subsequent slot with a probability p and"
"11-18","13:42","t of success okay so what does this mean this means okay if there is no clearance"
"11-18","13:48","I can directly send it out in the next slot but if there is a clearance okay"
"11-18","13:54","then I may try again in the uh second time slot"
"11-18","14:02","or in a third time slot or in a fourth time slot and to your success okay so"
"11-18","14:09","for each time slot I may try I may try so what is the probability of trying"
"11-18","14:15","probably is p okay I know you are you still you probably"
"11-18","14:22","still feel confused but let's now look an example and then you will feel better okay so for example"
"11-18","14:29","here you can see we already winding the time okay into different time slots okay each"
"11-18","14:38","time slot is uh Lor"
"11-18","14:43","now we may have node one who wants to send at this time slot"
"11-18","14:52","this time slot this one and also this one"
"11-18","14:57","okay so another two may also want to send nother may also want to send and"
"11-18","15:03","then you can see we may have clearance for example in the first time slot"
"11-18","15:13","not 102 and also they all want to transmit then this one is a clear"
"11-18","15:20","so then you you can look at the this third time slot"
"11-18","15:26","for third one we also have a clearance"
"11-18","15:31","okay this one is a success here"
"11-18","15:38","another cleaner and then this wine success this one's success"
"11-18","15:43","okay then you can see um the good thing of all the pearls of"
"11-18","15:49","slotting Allah is that a single active node can continuously transmit at four"
"11-18","15:57","root of r Okay add four reads out the channel"
"11-18","16:03","and this is a highly decentralized because we do not have any nose coordinating okay we only need the slots"
"11-18","16:12","in the nose to be synced okay"
"11-18","16:18","and this is also very simple but the console slotted Aloha is that we"
"11-18","16:25","have clearance okay we may have whisking slots okay a lot of clearance actually you can"
"11-18","16:31","see here we have uh three slots they have clearance okay and we only have"
"11-18","16:38","three slots success so the in this example the successful"
"11-18","16:44","read is like only 50 percent okay and we also have a lot of idol"
"11-18","16:49","slots okay um and also the nodes must be able to"
"11-18","16:55","tell the clearance as soon as possible okay um otherwise it's just a width of uh I"
"11-18","17:03","would say a whistle power okay or waste of time because we know if"
"11-18","17:08","um there is clearly even if you you if you still continue to transmit data it"
"11-18","17:14","will finally fail right and also we need the synchronization of"
"11-18","17:20","the clocks so that those are all the um disadvantages of the slotted aloha"
"11-18","17:27","and you may you may be curious about the efficiency for slotted Aloha okay uh the"
"11-18","17:33","efficiency okay is is basically means the long run fraction of the successful"
"11-18","17:40","slots okay that means if we have many nodes"
"11-18","17:46","all have all of those nodes have many frames to send then what is the"
"11-18","17:53","fraction of successful slots in the long run okay suppose we have nodes"
"11-18","18:01","with many frames to send each transmits in slot with the"
"11-18","18:06","probability p now we want to calculate the efficiency okay so now pay attention"
"11-18","18:12","we have unknowns okay we have nodes and we all want to send frames okay I"
"11-18","18:20","would say nothing the old ones to the many of them have streamed to to send"
"11-18","18:26","and each each transmits in slot with the probability option"
"11-18","18:33","that means in this time slot okay each node has a probability of P"
"11-18","18:43","to send a frame Okay then if we want to ensure"
"11-18","18:50","that a node is successful okay and we want to ensure"
"11-18","18:55","a given node has a success in a slot that means for example"
"11-18","19:02","if we look at only this time slot okay then for this given node"
"11-18","19:10","if we want we we know that in this time slot we may have multiple nodes right"
"11-18","19:16","not one two three and even more okay so let's now look at a node I"
"11-18","19:25","for this node I if we want this node I to be successful then we we know the"
"11-18","19:32","probability for this node I to send is p"
"11-18","19:38","foreign Ty for this node I to send a frame is p"
"11-18","19:43","okay and we want P to happen okay and at the same time we want to"
"11-18","19:52","ensure all the other nodes are silent all the other nodes they should not send"
"11-18","19:59","anything so how do we ensure they do not send anything that means"
"11-18","20:06","we need to have if they do not send then the probability for not sending is y"
"11-18","20:12","minus p probability for not sending is one minus P if we want to ensure n minus 1 notes"
"11-18","20:21","all being this all being silent at the same time then it is 1 minus P to the"
"11-18","20:27","power of n minus one okay so that is"
"11-18","20:33","the probability for node I to be successful of sending but now we need to"
"11-18","20:38","consider um we don't care if this is not I or not the J or node node X node C right so"
"11-18","20:46","that if we have unknowns as long as one of them is successful then we are happy"
"11-18","20:52","okay so that's why for and notes"
"11-18","20:58","if any of them is successful then the probability is n times"
"11-18","21:06","P times 1 minus P to the power of n minus one okay so that is actually the"
"11-18","21:13","probability for any node to be successful"
"11-18","21:19","okay then we need to find uh we need to know you may you may want to know what is the"
"11-18","21:26","what is the number for this okay so if we have a lot who knows"
"11-18","21:32","and um that means if n goes to Infinity"
"11-18","21:40","okay so then this entire thing will becomes 1 over e"
"11-18","21:47","this is about 0.37 okay so that means for slotted Aloha for"
"11-18","21:57","slotted Aloha uh the channel used for useful Transmissions"
"11-18","22:03","is um at best okay uh the Reit is uh we can"
"11-18","22:10","use only about 37 percent of the time okay you can see the efficiency is"
"11-18","22:16","actually very low very low that's why slotted Aloha is like it's um"
"11-18","22:22","I would say in terms of efficiency this is not a good choice for a mic box set"
"11-18","22:27","protocol okay and the second type of Aloha is uh pure uh or we call it"
"11-18","22:35","um Pure Aloha or and slotted Aloha okay so for an slotted Aloha for unsoluted"
"11-18","22:43","aloha basically the node can start at any time the transmission cannot can"
"11-18","22:51","start at any time it doesn't need to wait until the beginning of a slot so there is no time slot okay it can start"
"11-18","22:58","from any time and then as you can see the probability for Collision actually"
"11-18","23:04","increases right why because you can see if this is the node I we want this one"
"11-18","23:10","to be to be successful right if we want this one to be successful"
"11-18","23:15","then we need to ensure nobody is sending in this time frame"
"11-18","23:21","because if any node is starting in this time frame then it will likely hear me"
"11-18","23:30","how clearing okay it will likely use the time for by by node I"
"11-18","23:37","okay and we also need to ensure nobody is starting in this time slot because"
"11-18","23:43","you can see if this purple one starts here then we will have cleaner here"
"11-18","23:49","okay so because there is no time slots so it's easier to have clearance"
"11-18","23:56","okay so you may ask them what is the probability what is the efficiency for Pure Aloha for and slot in Aloha"
"11-18","24:03","so for unsoluted aloha we need to ensure this one to be successful"
"11-18","24:09","then the probability is p and we need to ensure nobody is sending"
"11-18","24:16","here then the probability is 1 minus P to the power of n minus 1."
"11-18","24:26","and we also need to ensure nobody is sending in this time frame"
"11-18","24:32","so then that is again 1 minus P to the power of n minus one"
"11-18","24:38","so in total this is actually p"
"11-18","24:48","okay this is the P times y minus P to"
"11-18","24:53","the power of 2 and minus one okay and again this is just for I node I"
"11-18","24:59","if we we doesn't care which node then this is n okay so the total for any node to be"
"11-18","25:07","success this is n times P times m y minus 1 to the power of 2 and minus one"
"11-18","25:13","so if this goes Infinity if this gets go to Infinity then it's about one over two"
"11-18","25:21","e so that is uh the equation is about half of slotted aloha"
"11-18","25:26","so now by calculation you know the Pure Aloha actually has an even lower efficiency than slotted aloha"
"11-18","25:34","okay I don't expect you to remember to know"
"11-18","25:39","how you do the calculation of probability Etc don't worry about that I will not give you the test"
"11-18","25:45","on those but what you need to know is um"
"11-18","25:51","the concluding the conclusion is that"
"11-18","25:58","has actually worse efficiency than slotted Aloha for both types we do not"
"11-18","26:04","have any like coordinator or something like that okay uh and we know because"
"11-18","26:10","the efficiencies is not very good so we we are thinking are there any other ways"
"11-18","26:15","for us to deal with this multi-access problem so one way we can use is called uh csma"
"11-18","26:24","the full name is Carrier sense multiple access uh the difference between csma"
"11-18","26:31","and sloged Aloha or Aloha is that um for CSM ma we always listen before"
"11-18","26:40","transmit okay that means if a channel is sensed idle then this uh station or this"
"11-18","26:49","node can transmit the entire frame if the channel is sensed busy then we can"
"11-18","26:56","this station will defer the transmission so it's very similar to the human"
"11-18","27:02","conversation right so in human transition we don't want to interrupt others"
"11-18","27:08","um that means when you want to say something for example if it is in our class okay we"
"11-18","27:14","are in a let's imagine we are in a classroom setting then uh if you want to"
"11-18","27:19","say something you need to First listen to others and listen to the channels if if there is anybody else saying or"
"11-18","27:27","speaking then if there are there is nobody speaking that you can speak if there are somebody else speaking then"
"11-18","27:34","you need to wait until they finish okay so that is like the the basic uh"
"11-18","27:40","principle of csma um then you think about this"
"11-18","27:46","it it sounds like csma is perfect right um but do we still have calculations can"
"11-18","27:52","we still have clearance the answer is uh yes we we can still have clearance okay so for example for"
"11-18","28:01","example um when you start to say something okay you you may have sensed oh okay this is"
"11-18","28:07","Idle okay this channel is Idle then you start to speak okay but at the same time"
"11-18","28:13","somebody else may also send this Idol and uh he or she starts to speak so you may"
"11-18","28:20","start at the same time okay uh that is one reason that we may"
"11-18","28:25","have clear okay so the same thing two notes may start transmitting at the same time because they both sense that the idol so"
"11-18","28:33","since the channel idle um but there is also a second reason a"
"11-18","28:39","second reason um is that this nose this nose may be"
"11-18","28:46","far away from each other okay and the signal propagation actually takes time"
"11-18","28:54","so when the node sends that the channel is Idle okay"
"11-18","28:59","the channel may not be idle actually okay it's just the signal is still propagating it hasn't arrived at this"
"11-18","29:08","node yet okay it's like um"
"11-18","29:14","for for example you and your friends okay you are far away from each other"
"11-18","29:19","you shout to each other and the sound takes time to propagate"
"11-18","29:24","okay you may sense the idol but actually it's just the uh the the The Voice or"
"11-18","29:32","the sound from your friend hasn't reached it at you yet okay uh that is"
"11-18","29:37","another reason why the Collision is still occur okay"
"11-18","29:42","basically propagation delay means two nodes may not hear each other's transmission okay"
"11-18","29:50","so now let's look at uh example here we have four computers okay and this is the"
"11-18","29:56","special layout of nodes we have t0 at t0 this note stars to uh send out the"
"11-18","30:06","packet okay and pay attention this is the time okay and then the the"
"11-18","30:15","um package or the signal will propagate to both directions as"
"11-18","30:23","the time goes by okay so then we can see uh you can see here the signal is"
"11-18","30:29","propagating in this way to both directions As Time increase"
"11-18","30:36","okay and at this time you can see uh this computer"
"11-18","30:42","this was May sense that may sense the channel is idle"
"11-18","30:48","okay and then this computer may say okay uh the channel is Idle I can start"
"11-18","30:54","transmitting my package so this computer will start transmitting okay it the"
"11-18","31:02","reason it sends the idle is because the signal is it's just appropriate to hear at T1 it hasn't reached this"
"11-18","31:12","that's the reason why this computer sends the item okay so then you can say they continue"
"11-18","31:19","they continue and then at this point at this point this two"
"11-18","31:25","signals meet each other at this point at this special notes okay and they"
"11-18","31:32","continue again at this time actually both these two computers hasn't haven't"
"11-18","31:37","realized but clearly they haven't sensed the screen yet because a signal didn't"
"11-18","31:43","reach them yet okay the other side teaches them yet so then we continue and"
"11-18","31:50","you can see finally finally"
"11-18","31:56","at this point okay at this point let's give them some"
"11-18","32:03","name a b c d okay at this point computer B sends to"
"11-18","32:09","the calendar why because you can see it is the transmitting the signal the packet at"
"11-18","32:17","the same time it is actually receiving a signal from"
"11-18","32:23","computer d right so you can see at this point okay at this point computer D now"
"11-18","32:30","sends the Declaration because again while it is translating the packet it is"
"11-18","32:36","also receiving uh the signal from computer B okay so"
"11-18","32:42","then in this case you can see um if they do not stop okay they will just continue transmit transmission okay"
"11-18","32:50","both B and D are still continued transmission and this in this case then we can see"
"11-18","32:57","it's actually a Visa of time and energy right uh the entire package transmission"
"11-18","33:03","time is actually listed okay this is the csma"
"11-18","33:09","um method okay you can see finally the completed their transmission okay but we know it"
"11-18","33:17","is a waste of time and energy because uh the both Transmissions are failures okay"
"11-18","33:26","um so then we want to improve the csma method okay because csma we know when"
"11-18","33:35","they detect after they detect the Collision ideally they should stop right because"
"11-18","33:41","there's no reason to continue if they continue it's just a waste of time because we know it's already a failure"
"11-18","33:47","right um that's why we now have a included"
"11-18","33:52","version of csma that is csma CD csma with Collision detection okay so"
"11-18","34:01","csmicd uh in in this uh the clearance will be detected within a very short"
"11-18","34:07","time period okay when we detected the when we detect the Clarion that we will"
"11-18","34:13","abort the transmission immediately okay because there is no reason to"
"11-18","34:19","continue or because we after we find the clearance okay"
"11-18","34:26","um so this cleaning detection you need to know is very easy to detect in wired"
"11-18","34:31","lens okay um because we can easily mirror the signal strength we can compare the"
"11-18","34:37","transmitted and received signals but it may be very difficult to detect"
"11-18","34:44","Collision in the wireless lens the reason is because when this node is"
"11-18","34:49","sending the packet okay the signal is usually very"
"11-18","34:56","strong it's much stronger than the uh the signal that it is receiving"
"11-18","35:03","okay so then in this case the received signal strength may be overwhelmed by the local transmission student then you"
"11-18","35:11","cannot detect the calculator okay so that is uh the csmacd and you can see"
"11-18","35:17","then you can see here okay here"
"11-18","35:23","um again we have a b c d here A B you can say B detector"
"11-18","35:30","clearance and then it takes a little bit time to abort this transmission similarly D detects the cleaner at this"
"11-18","35:38","point and it takes some time to abort this transmission okay so then in this"
"11-18","35:44","case we actually save at least receives the time and energy after Collision is"
"11-18","35:50","detected okay um so this is the ethernet csma CD"
"11-18","35:57","algorithm first step when Nick received the datagram from the network layer it will"
"11-18","36:03","firstly create a frame and then if the Nick senses Channel idle it will start the"
"11-18","36:10","frame transmission so if it sends the channel busy then we"
"11-18","36:16","will wait until the channel is uh idle okay uh if Nick transmits entire frame"
"11-18","36:23","without detecting another transmission then we are done okay this this is done"
"11-18","36:28","with the frame it's a successful transmission however it needs detects"
"11-18","36:34","another transmission while transmitting it will need to abort and then send a"
"11-18","36:41","jam signal okay after a boarding Nick will enter a"
"11-18","36:48","very special phase that cause binary back off okay what does this mean as we"
"11-18","36:53","can imagine when when the first transmission failed we will try again right but when should we try"
"11-18","37:00","you should be trying again immediately that's probably not a good idea right"
"11-18","37:05","because maybe the other transmission hasn't finished yet okay so that usually what how do we"
"11-18","37:13","decide when to transmit again when to do the real transmission we use the binary"
"11-18","37:19","back off so this means after the amp clearing"
"11-18","37:25","Nick choose a number k"
"11-18","37:30","randomly from 0 to 2 to M minus 1."
"11-18","37:36","so this for example if m equals to 3 okay that means Nick will choose a"
"11-18","37:45","number randomly from 0 to 7. okay and then it will wait for K times"
"11-18","37:55","512 bit times and then do the real transmission again then as you can imagine as m is getting"
"11-18","38:03","bigger then this number this this range is getting bigger"
"11-18","38:08","right then very likely this number k will be bigger because it's chosen"
"11-18","38:16","randomly okay then it has a probability of getting choosing a bigger K"
"11-18","38:23","like choosing a bigger King and then Nick will wait for longer time"
"11-18","38:31","to do the real transmission okay so then this is what we call as binary back off"
"11-18","38:37","it's the general idea is basically um if we have more clearance then we"
"11-18","38:43","usually will be a bit longer to re-transmitter again but this is not 100"
"11-18","38:49","guaranteed with I mean weekend language is not 100 guaranteed because we are"
"11-18","38:54","choosing a random number from this range okay from this range"
"11-18","39:01","um that means we get we still give opportunities for them to re-transmit immediately so um"
"11-18","39:09","you may ask what is the efficiency for"
"11-18","39:14","um for csmacd okay"
"11-18","39:21","something is wrong with this I think"
"11-18","39:27","okay so the efficiency is actually determined"
"11-18","39:32","by this tea prop which is the maximum"
"11-18","39:40","Corporation delay between two nodes Inland okay and then T transmission the"
"11-18","39:46","time to transmit the maximum size frame okay"
"11-18","39:52","um so basically efficiency equal to I don't know what happened but the this"
"11-18","39:58","efficiency equals to 1 over 1 minus"
"11-18","40:05","5 times T prop divided by T transmission okay"
"11-18","40:11","so basically um"
"11-18","40:16","if if this propagation delay goes to zero okay then you can see the efficiency"
"11-18","40:26","efficiency will go to one okay because it's equal to one my over one minus zero"
"11-18","40:33","that is uh almost that that is a one okay so that means if this true nose can"
"11-18","40:40","hear each other immediately okay immediately then we can have a very"
"11-18","40:46","high efficiency we do not have a lot of clearance that's uh that's why okay or"
"11-18","40:52","if the time to transmit goes to Infinity"
"11-18","40:57","okay if this goes to Infinity then um this efficiency this entire this"
"11-18","41:04","number is equals to zero and then this efficient is also going to one that"
"11-18","41:11","means here for the transmission time takes forever okay that means they can never finish"
"11-18","41:18","transmission okay the signals are all uh kept at each node"
"11-18","41:25","um and then in this case efficiency is also one okay so this is a like uh the"
"11-18","41:31","formula for defining the efficiency but anyway so this we can see efficiency"
"11-18","41:37","this csmacd actually has a much better performance than Aloha okay it is simple"
"11-18","41:44","shape and also decentralized so that's why csma CD is very widely used okay"
"11-18","41:52","uh so far we have talked about the channel partitioning Mac protocols first time uh that type we know we learned as"
"11-18","42:01","a ftdma fdma okay second type is the"
"11-18","42:06","random access map protocols we learned slotted Aloha Pure Aloha we also learned"
"11-18","42:13","csma and csmacd okay that is the second type uh the third type is the taking turns"
"11-18","42:21","protocol taking turns is actually um"
"11-18","42:26","is a is a like a combination of China partitioning and the random access okay"
"11-18","42:33","the the idea"
"11-21","0:04","just okay uh so far we have talked about the"
"11-21","0:09","channel partitioning Mac protocols first time uh that type we know we learned as"
"11-21","0:15","a ftdma fdma okay second type is the"
"11-21","0:20","random access map protocols we learned slotted Aloha Pure Aloha we also learned"
"11-21","0:27","csma and csma CD okay that is the second type uh the third type is the taking turns"
"11-21","0:35","protocol taking turns is actually um"
"11-21","0:40","is a is a like a combination of Channel partitioning and the random access okay"
"11-21","0:47","the the idea is also very easy for example here we can say we have a master"
"11-21","0:54","node and a number of sleeve nodes okay but masternodes is like the coordinator"
"11-21","0:59","in the in the middle so the masternodes will invite the cliff the slim nodes to"
"11-21","1:05","transmit in turn okay so for example Master will say hey do"
"11-21","1:11","you have data to send then the first node we'll see I have data then it will answer the second one and say if you"
"11-21","1:18","have what data to send okay second one may say no Okay the third one say I have data so it's like that uh so basically"
"11-21","1:26","the master will invite every every uh sleeve node to transmit in turn Okay the"
"11-21","1:34","concern for this kind of Mac protocol is that firstly we have the polling"
"11-21","1:40","overhead okay the polling it it has hot cost okay"
"11-21","1:46","secondly we may have latency okay because every time you need to ask"
"11-21","1:53","um uh you need to you need to ask if the computer has data to send okay uh it"
"11-21","1:59","takes time the third concern is the single point of failure as you can imagine if the master is down then"
"11-21","2:07","basically this Mac protocol will not work okay so nobody can send it out that"
"11-21","2:13","is uh those are the concerns for this uh polling protocol okay"
"11-21","2:22","um the second type of taking turns is called token party token passing"
"11-21","2:28","um the the reason what you talk about passing is that we want to remove this"
"11-21","2:33","uh Master this coordinator okay so in token passing we do not have any"
"11-21","2:39","coordinator uh basically we have a control token that is passed from one"
"11-21","2:45","node to the next node sequentially and then they take turns to send it out for"
"11-21","2:50","example you can see but this one has nothing to send the token is passed to the next one"
"11-21","2:57","and this one has data to send out okay and the next uh then we can"
"11-21","3:03","continue uh if you if you think about this uh actually token cutting also have"
"11-21","3:08","several drawbacks firstly we need to have a token okay token has overhead"
"11-21","3:14","secondly latency problem the same thing okay so every time we need to uh firstly"
"11-21","3:20","use the token to ask and then we can send uh the third thing the third one is the"
"11-21","3:27","single point of failure again but this time it is uh uh not the"
"11-21","3:33","um the single point of failure is not about the masternode it's actually about the token if for some reason the token"
"11-21","3:40","is lost okay then this again this for this entire uh loop on every Network"
"11-21","3:47","nobody can send the data out okay"
"11-21","3:52","so this is a keyboard Access Network this is a real Network okay let's look"
"11-21","3:59","at the structure and see what what will happen so firstly this is the cable hand and"
"11-21","4:07","okay and we have the keyboard modem termination system these are all the"
"11-21","4:14","home networks okay this is one a big a big one uh and for each home network you can see"
"11-21","4:20","we have splitter and the cable model okay we know the cable modem is"
"11-21","4:27","basically used to convert the signals from uh from the audio signals or cable"
"11-21","4:35","signals to the digital signal right to for the conversion and splitter is used"
"11-21","4:40","to to split the different type of signals um and actually for this entire"
"11-21","4:47","structure as you can see we have the multiple access problem okay for the downstream"
"11-21","4:54","for the downstream uh we basically we can say oh okay we have different type"
"11-21","5:00","of signals for example we have Internet frames we have TV channels we have also"
"11-21","5:06","the um maybe control signals Etc okay so all"
"11-21","5:12","those different type of signals can be transmitted at different type of frequencies"
"11-21","5:19","okay different frequencies so this is a like fdma right so this is a like"
"11-21","5:26","Channel partitioning okay and then for the Upstream for the"
"11-21","5:32","Upstream um signals we have competitions because"
"11-21","5:38","many home networks okay some of the home networks they they all want to synapse"
"11-21","5:44","the signal they all want to send the signals to um the cable hand ends okay then they"
"11-21","5:51","have computation um which is what we call as a multi-process problem okay then in this"
"11-21","5:59","case okay in this case we may have different signals transmitted at different"
"11-21","6:06","frequencies in different time slots okay so here we use both of the"
"11-21","6:11","frequency dividend and also uh time difference okay"
"11-21","6:18","um so you can see for Downstream it's easy for Upstream Downstream because we"
"11-21","6:23","are just doing the broadcast channels for Upstream then all the users contend"
"11-21","6:29","for certain Upstream Channel time slots okay so what is a really happening"
"11-21","6:35","actually is that um"
"11-21","6:40","so for um we what we do is we use fdm over"
"11-21","6:48","Upstream Downstream uh frequency channels this for this one we already know right"
"11-21","6:54","and then for um"
"11-21","6:59","and therefore Upstream for Upstream uh"
"11-21","7:04","uh data okay so for Upstream transmission what we do is we actually"
"11-21","7:10","firstly uh you apply okay we apply uh"
"11-21","7:16","and say hey for example this this is home network will say hey I want to send something out okay uh what can I do okay"
"11-21","7:25","then it will send some requests to the keyboard hands okay the cable"
"11-21","7:33","headings will assign some of the slots assign some slots in the downstream map"
"11-21","7:42","frame so basically it will tell this home network say Hey you can use this"
"11-21","7:48","time interval from T1 to T2 okay then later uh this home network can"
"11-21","7:55","use uh the time from T1 to T2 to um uh up to upload data okay to to do"
"11-21","8:04","Upstream transmission so it is like that okay"
"11-21","8:11","and then the request for Upstream slots is actually transmitted"
"11-21","8:18","um using random access okay using random access so you can see in reality the real network is like a"
"11-21","8:26","combination of different methods fdma tdma and we also use the random access"
"11-21","8:33","okay like for Random Access again we have different uh types like it's Aloha"
"11-21","8:40","it's not in Aloha Pure Aloha csma CSM SCD Etc okay"
"11-21","8:46","so basically the general the general idea is the first lay you request you"
"11-21","8:52","make a request for time slots okay so this request is"
"11-21","8:58","made by using random access and then um the time interval will be assigned"
"11-21","9:05","using the downstream channel to this home computer home network and the home network then can upload uh or send up"
"11-21","9:14","Upstream data using the time slot assigned okay so"
"11-21","9:21","that is uh the general idea um and I"
"11-21","9:27","to summarize what we have learned we basically learned these three different types of Mac protocols and I really want"
"11-21","9:34","you to um remember all of this okay and there are features you should understand we"
"11-21","9:40","will definitely um have questions about Mac in the final exam okay"
"11-21","9:48","all right so the next thing we are going to discuss today is the land"
"11-21","9:53","okay uh for land we will firstly look at the MAC address"
"11-21","9:59","okay Mac address we we have learned IP address we know IP address is 32-bit"
"11-21","10:05","right so it is the network layer address for interface for the new card okay uh"
"11-21","10:13","and this is a used for uh basically forwarding and routing"
"11-21","10:19","um and then for each device we know we all we often we mention a MAC address Mac address but do you really know what"
"11-21","10:26","is a MAC address so the functionality for MAC address is"
"11-21","10:33","actually to um get frame locally from one interface to another physically"
"11-21","10:42","connected interface okay so that means Mac address is actually used mainly for"
"11-21","10:49","the local area network okay between the neighbors between the direct Neighbors"
"11-21","10:55","okay and a MAC address is 48 bit okay this is a burn into the neck roll"
"11-21","11:04","um and uh sometimes we can use salt water to set up the MAC address but most of"
"11-21","11:10","the time for most of most of Mac addresses they are just burning them and"
"11-21","11:16","I think um usually we do not change the MAC address okay"
"11-21","11:21","and if you look at the MAC address again as I said it's a 48 bit so then we can"
"11-21","11:27","represent this with the hex decimal here each letter or each number"
"11-21","11:34","represents four bits okay so four B so that means we have for"
"11-21","11:39","this entire Mac address it has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"
"11-21","11:44","eleven twelve we should have twelve letter or uh number has this more"
"11-21","11:51","lateral number okay um and pay attention"
"11-21","11:57","the IPv6 okay the IPv6 the IP address"
"11-21","12:04","is also representing the E hex decimal okay"
"11-21","12:10","but it's much longer it's 128 bits okay so it's much longer than mac"
"11-21","12:16","address sometimes uh students say oh why do I see also accessible in your IP address that"
"11-21","12:25","is because it is using IPv6 okay"
"11-21","12:30","so now let's look at the Lan addresses so basically"
"11-21","12:36","um this is a lamp and you can see each adapter each new card has its own unique"
"11-21","12:43","unique Mac address okay unique language someone you may ask why we already have"
"11-21","12:52","the IP address why do we still need a MAC address okay what is what is the"
"11-21","12:58","reason for having a MAC address so"
"11-21","13:03","um the macro address is like it's a very unique it's Unique to every adapter so"
"11-21","13:12","it can be used to uniquely identify each computer each interface and also it is portable"
"11-21","13:19","you think about this so for example when you take your computer from your"
"11-21","13:24","home network to campus Network the IP address may have changed right"
"11-21","13:31","but the um the MAC address is still the"
"11-21","13:36","same for a computer is still the same it's not changed so you can see this is a MAC address is portable it's just"
"11-21","13:43","similar to um to to a human if we think about human"
"11-21","13:50","society everybody has a social security number right and everybody also has a home"
"11-21","13:56","address when you move from one place to another place your home address can change your"
"11-21","14:02","postal address can change but your social security number is always with"
"11-21","14:07","you it's never changed okay so the MAC address is like the social security"
"11-21","14:12","number and the IP address is like the postal address okay Mac address is"
"11-21","14:17","basically used to uniquely identify a interface"
"11-21","14:25","um you may also ask them how can they ensure the MAC address is unique to"
"11-21","14:31","every device okay um basically the MAC address allocation"
"11-21","14:39","is administrated by IEEE and then the manufacturer needs to buy a"
"11-21","14:47","portion of Mac address space to ensure the uniqueness okay it buys a"
"11-21","14:53","portion of Mac address space and then when it's manufactured uh the new card"
"11-21","15:00","it will assign a unique Mac address to each device okay to each me card"
"11-21","15:06","[Music] um so that is the basically the difference between IP address and Mac address"
"11-21","15:14","then now we may have a problem okay you may have a question"
"11-21","15:21","um so if we already know if we already know the IP address of our computer IP"
"11-21","15:27","address or Y interface how do we know the MAC address for that interface"
"11-21","15:35","the answer is that we can have we can use a protocol called address resolution"
"11-21","15:40","protocol which is a arp okay and this is a very uh commonly used"
"11-21","15:48","protocol very useful protocol and please pay attention to this so"
"11-21","15:54","basically for ARP firstly we have ARP table okay"
"11-21","16:00","um each IP node on the land has a table called ARP table"
"11-21","16:07","and then in this Erp table we will store the mapping between IP address and Mac"
"11-21","16:13","address of course we also give it the TTL TTM means time to leave"
"11-21","16:19","um it's basically means how long will this mating be uh"
"11-21","16:27","effective okay so after TTL then the address mapping will be forgotten"
"11-21","16:34","so typically the TCL is 20 minutes um"
"11-21","16:39","so let's look at how this ARP protocol worked okay"
"11-21","16:44","um I think maybe maybe I start with this example and then"
"11-21","16:50","we come back to explain okay"
"11-21","16:56","um this is another one okay let's come back"
"11-21","17:02","to this so firstly firstly if we let's assume let's assume a wants to send a datagram"
"11-21","17:10","to B and A and B are in the same land this is a very important pay attention"
"11-21","17:17","A and B are in the same length Okay basically means they are not neighbors"
"11-21","17:23","okay and we know when a sends something to B okay"
"11-21","17:30","in addition to the IP address actually at the link layer a link layer does not"
"11-21","17:35","know any IP address link layer means the MAC address to deliver a packet"
"11-21","17:41","okay so that's why if a amount to send something to B A must know B's Mac"
"11-21","17:49","address keep this in mind a must know piece Mac"
"11-21","17:54","address okay but unfortunately this Mac address is"
"11-21","18:00","not ease Erp table yet do you remember we said every note"
"11-21","18:06","has a ARP table right the Erp table has IP address and the MAC address so"
"11-21","18:12","ideally we should have B's IP address and the B is a MAC address"
"11-21","18:20","here okay but here at the very beginning we a do not have this Mac address in its"
"11-21","18:27","own Erp table and what a can do is a can broadcast the ARP query"
"11-21","18:35","to everybody in this line okay to everybody in this land"
"11-21","18:40","containing this IP address it will basically ask say"
"11-21","18:46","hey who has this IP address okay"
"11-21","18:51","then you may ask how can we do the broadcasting actually we mentioned this before I think when we talk about DHCP"
"11-21","18:58","if we want to do the Broadcasting okay the destination Mac address should"
"11-21","19:04","be FF ffff so 12 F's"
"11-21","19:11","okay 12 apps This Is How We Do Broadcasting okay and all the notes all"
"11-21","19:18","the notes on this line will receive this NRP query okay it's like if for example if I'm a I"
"11-21","19:26","do not know B's Mac address I only know B's in IP address then I will shout to"
"11-21","19:32","everybody to all my neighbors asking say hey who has this IP address"
"11-21","19:38","okay then when B receives the RRP packet B will reply to a with its own Mac"
"11-21","19:46","address okay then this um"
"11-21","19:52","um this Frame is sent to A's Mac address directly through unicast because V knows"
"11-21","19:58","is Mac address right then after that a will basically save the"
"11-21","20:06","this IP to MAC address pair in its own ID its own ARP table"
"11-21","20:13","okay um until the information becomes out so"
"11-21","20:18","that that means after that before this expires a can directly send uh the frame"
"11-21","20:25","to B because a now knows B's Mac address okay so that is the general idea of ARP"
"11-21","20:32","if they are if the source and destination are within the same length"
"11-21","20:37","Okay so this uh pay attention ARP protocol is Plug and Play protocol uh"
"11-21","20:43","they do not need any information from the net Network admin okay no need from"
"11-21","20:49","Network enemy um so this is the uh the ARP protocol"
"11-21","20:55","when they are in the same land okay it's very easy just a shout to"
"11-21","21:01","everybody okay um so then the route into another line is a"
"11-21","21:09","little bit more complicated let me see let's move let's finish this try to finish this okay"
"11-21","21:15","if if a and b are not in the same length"
"11-21","21:21","okay if a and b are not in the same line then a cannot shout anymore"
"11-21","21:27","because they need to go through a router here okay so when a sharp a can only shout to"
"11-21","21:34","this length it cannot shelter to the other line it can only shout to its"
"11-21","21:40","neighbor okay then in this case what can we do if a wants to send something for to B"
"11-21","21:48","through a router r okay uh now let's assume a knows B's IP"
"11-21","21:55","address B is the destination and we also assume a knows the IP"
"11-21","22:02","address of the first hop router are a knows IP address or"
"11-21","22:11","How could a nodes know um the IP address of first half grams"
"11-21","22:16","are sorry not this one sorry not this one"
"11-21","22:21","okay let me see hmm"
"11-21","22:27","it's actually this one okay this is uh Earth's IP address at"
"11-21","22:34","the at the left side of that okay and isline so how could a know the IP address of"
"11-21","22:43","first half router are How could a know this IP address"
"11-21","22:48","the answer is actually DHCP"
"11-21","22:54","foreign DHCP we said when a new computer"
"11-21","23:01","a joins a network okay join the network"
"11-21","23:08","it needs to talk to a DHCP server then the DHCP server will return is IP"
"11-21","23:14","address and also some other information the other information are"
"11-21","23:20","info for example the information the IP address about the first half router"
"11-21","23:25","the IP address or the DNS server and the name of the DN server and also the uh"
"11-21","23:32","the the network mask right so this information are sent"
"11-21","23:37","to a by the DHCP server okay that's how that's how a get this IP address"
"11-21","23:45","and third assumption is that we also assume a knows R's Mac address"
"11-21","23:50","How could a know RS Mac address the answer is using arp"
"11-21","23:59","why because we know this adapter is actually within the same length of a right so we"
"11-21","24:08","just learned if they are in the same length a can simply shout it can simply"
"11-21","24:13","ask say hey who has this IP address of one zero"
"11-21","24:20","okay then our out interface will return this Mac address to a that's how a gets"
"11-21","24:27","to know uh arithmetic address so with these three assumptions let's continue"
"11-21","24:35","okay then now a will create I iptogram with IP Source"
"11-21","24:43","a and destination B okay you can see source is 101.101 destination is two to two"
"11-21","24:50","okay then when might comes down comes to the lower layer link layer you can see the"
"11-21","24:57","source address source Mac address is is source Mac"
"11-21","25:03","address the destination address however is not B's Mac address"
"11-21","25:09","because because what because we don't know this Mac address yet we only know"
"11-21","25:16","Earth's Mac address right we know this Mac address"
"11-21","25:21","okay how do we know we assume we already know that right through arp"
"11-21","25:27","so that's why you can see the MAC address here is actually"
"11-21","25:33","ours Mac address pay attention is not a busy Mac address okay now this Frame is"
"11-21","25:39","sent from a to R okay and then"
"11-21","25:45","and then what this art will do is is Reverb it will remove the link layer"
"11-21","25:53","headers okay and then add a new header in this new header The Source address"
"11-21","26:01","the source Mac address is now this Mac address it's also the other"
"11-21","26:08","interface okay uh the Romans the other interfaces so this Mac address is a 1A"
"11-21","26:14","29b okay the destination address this time is uh B is Mac address"
"11-21","26:23","okay because the router this interface is within the same line as B so of"
"11-21","26:31","course um this interface can also shout to this uh uh this line and ask hey who has this"
"11-21","26:39","IP address and I who has this IP address and then B can return its own Mac address okay so anyway this Mac address"
"11-21","26:48","OB can be known by this interface that's why you can see uh the MAC address"
"11-21","26:53","definition is actually big okay the source IP Source address destination"
"11-21","26:59","address are not changed it's the same okay so then now this Frame can be sent"
"11-21","27:05","to be okay and then B can remove the link"
"11-21","27:10","layer headers and pass this to Upper load layer okay so that is the ARP and"
"11-21","27:17","you can see when they are within the same length if the source and definitions are in the within the same"
"11-21","27:22","line then they can simply Shout but if they are not in the same line then they have to change the MAC address"
"11-21","27:29","to the router's MAC address okay to the router's MAC address and"
"11-21","27:36","then the router will do the forwarding for them since the ARP is a very important part I want to quickly review"
"11-21","27:42","this okay so firstly we learned we learned ARP is a red address resolution"
"11-21","27:48","protocol this is basically used to determine the interface's map address"
"11-21","27:54","when we know it's IP address okay um so if the source and the destination"
"11-21","28:01","are in the same land then Erp protocol is very easy it's very straightforward so basically the source will say hey uh"
"11-21","28:09","who has this IP address shouting to everybody we call this as broadcasting right so how do we do the broadcasting"
"11-21","28:16","we use uh the MAC address of ff12x as the MAC address right"
"11-21","28:23","and then uh the the destination who has this IP address will reply with its own"
"11-21","28:29","Mac address and then the source will cache this ip2 Mac address pair in its"
"11-21","28:36","Erp table that is the Erp protocol when we have a and b in the same line the"
"11-21","28:43","problem is what if a and b are in different lands okay when they are in"
"11-21","28:49","different lands we know we cannot shout to each other okay we cannot shout because we have we have to go through a"
"11-21","28:55","browser first so then in this case we have to assume a no B's IP address how"
"11-21","29:02","do we know because this definition of course we know this IP address right and then we also assume not any nodes IP"
"11-21","29:09","address over the first half browser which is uh which is r okay so how do we know that"
"11-21","29:17","so we learned with we can do this through DHCP right because we learned hcp does not only return DCP is a"
"11-21","29:25","protocol that is used to return or assign an IP address to a"
"11-21","29:32","newly joined uh computer right so then we know DHCP does not only return the"
"11-21","29:40","mat the the new IP address for this new computer new camera it also introduced"
"11-21","29:46","this newcomer uh the important roles in this network right so like who"
"11-21","29:54","is the first half launcher what is the IP address or the first Hub browser so what is the DNS server right"
"11-21","30:01","and what is the network mask so those information are also returned by DHCP"
"11-21","30:07","that's how a no a at the IP address our"
"11-21","30:12","first Hub router are okay and you need to pay attention R actually has two"
"11-21","30:17","interfaces in this in this scenario y interface belongs to the same name with"
"11-21","30:23","uh a okay the other interface belongs to the same line with B okay so now we"
"11-21","30:30","assume a node IP address over the first of router are that IP address is the"
"11-21","30:36","interface belonging to Ace line not a business okay pay attention to that and"
"11-21","30:42","we also assume a knows r as a MAC address how do we know more as Mac address that is very straightforward"
"11-21","30:50","because this interface is in the same line as a"
"11-21","30:56","okay so then we can simply do a Erp because they are in the same line Erp is very easy a just a shout to everybody"
"11-21","31:04","and ask hey who has this IP address and then R can reply so"
"11-21","31:10","um those are the three assumptions with those assumptions and then we can see if"
"11-21","31:16","we want to send something okay uh we have IP address uh IP Source IP address"
"11-21","31:23","destination IP address and then for the map for the link layer we need to add"
"11-21","31:28","headers we also need to add the link layer Source address and destination address right so basically the source"
"11-21","31:34","Mac address and the source destination Mac address and very importantly the source Mac"
"11-21","31:41","address is its Mac address but the destination and Mac address is not"
"11-21","31:47","this Mac address is actually our Mac address that is"
"11-21","31:52","something you need to pay attention okay that means firstly we forward this package to our to the neighbor R and"
"11-21","32:01","then R will forward this"
"11-21","32:06","okay R will basically move this from one side to another side"
"11-21","32:12","okay from one interface to another interface and then add a new Mac Source"
"11-21","32:18","address this time the map Source address is replaced with ours"
"11-21","32:23","um the other in Mac address okay this Mac address of"
"11-21","32:29","um of work okay so that is the source address and the destination address"
"11-21","32:34","destination address destination Mac address is this time it can be beats Mac address okay can be"
"11-21","32:42","business Mac address and then this uh can be sent to B and finally B will"
"11-21","32:47","remove those headers nuclear headers and pass this to operate okay so this is the"
"11-21","32:53","entire process and um we will definitely have this kind of"
"11-21","32:58","questions on the final exam so for example I may ask you uh in this"
"11-21","33:03","scenario what is the destination Mac address what is the sales Mac address okay can you can you give the MAC"
"11-21","33:11","address okay like that"
"11-23","0:05","the next thing we are going to discuss is uh in Ethernet okay ethernet is the"
"11-23","0:11","dominant wire land technology we are actually still using it right now right"
"11-23","0:17","um so you can see this is this uh this figure is actually the uh sketch for the"
"11-23","0:24","ethernet at the very beginning okay um and um over the time we have developed"
"11-23","0:31","different types of ethernet so firstly we have bus bus type structure okay this"
"11-23","0:36","is very popular so mid 90s and then gradually we learned okay this this will"
"11-23","0:42","have some problems because we may we may easily have the multiple access problem"
"11-23","0:47","we may have the Collision uh happening okay so that's why people"
"11-23","0:52","gradually um switch the bus structure to star kind"
"11-23","0:58","of structure okay the right side is the star structure in this structure we"
"11-23","1:03","always have a switch in the middle okay and then uh each computer or each each interface"
"11-23","1:11","is actually connected directly with the switch okay did not connect with each"
"11-23","1:16","other um so this is the ethernet frame structure"
"11-23","1:22","okay so basically the sending adapter encapses the IP datagram in the ethernet"
"11-23","1:30","frame okay so the iptogram is here in the data it's the payload okay and"
"11-23","1:38","then we have the preamble preamble is um uh is a very special string of uh bits"
"11-23","1:48","okay so the it's basically uh seven bytes"
"11-23","1:54","of this salmon buys a one zero one zero one zero one zero this is one byte right"
"11-23","2:00","so we repeat this for seven times and Then followed by one byte hour one"
"11-23","2:08","zero one zero one zero one one okay so what is this for this is the use of four"
"11-23","2:14","pre-m for for synchronization okay for synchronized between the sender and"
"11-23","2:19","receiver's clock um and then we have the source and"
"11-23","2:24","destination destination Source address okay those addresses are pay attention those are Mac addresses okay not IP"
"11-23","2:32","address because the IP address we know is seeing that IP disk program okay so"
"11-23","2:37","these are the Mac addresses um and we know the MAC address is a 48 bits"
"11-23","2:46","that means uh six byte for each okay and then this field is the type this type"
"11-23","2:54","indicates the higher layer protocol mostly IEP okay uh and then this is the"
"11-23","3:02","CRC CRC we have learned that right psycholic redundance checking uh this is"
"11-23","3:08","a for error detection and error tracking okay"
"11-23","3:17","um so for ethernet we know uh this is a connectionless connection list doesn't"
"11-23","3:23","mean we do not need cables to connect them connection isn't here means at the"
"11-23","3:28","lower layer at link layer we do not need to do any hand shaking to establish a"
"11-23","3:34","connection no handshaking between the sending and receiving new curves okay"
"11-23","3:40","and um this is unreliable because"
"11-23","3:46","um the receiving new card doesn't does not send any sicks or any Keys choose to"
"11-23","3:54","the sending Nick okay the data in drops frames recovered only if the initial"
"11-23","4:00","sender uses a higher layer rdt so you can say"
"11-23","4:05","um we do not have any reliability uh in"
"11-23","4:11","um in the in the ethernet protocol okay no reliability if you want to ensure"
"11-23","4:17","reliability to transfer then you have to re rely on upper layer which are the"
"11-23","4:22","transport layer okay which is the transport layer and then"
"11-23","4:28","um the Mac protocol here Mac is is a means multi-access protocol right"
"11-23","4:34","multiple search protocol is and slotted csma CD with binary back off"
"11-23","4:41","csma means we always listen before we send right and CD means clear detection"
"11-23","4:48","that means when we detect any clearance then we will immediately stop"
"11-23","4:55","um transmitting the packet okay that is Sesame macd and binary back off means"
"11-23","5:01","what means that we will try to resend with a probability okay resend this uh"
"11-23","5:07","this one with the probability of this Frame um so there are many different ethernet"
"11-23","5:14","standards actually depending on different links and different physical"
"11-23","5:20","layer implementations um so you can see uh these are the"
"11-23","5:26","physical layer if the if we are using physically copper physical year then these are the"
"11-23","5:34","protocols and then the red color is for fiber physical layer okay different protocols"
"11-23","5:42","um that's all about the ethernet so the next thing is which"
"11-23","5:48","is a very important device in link layer"
"11-23","5:54","um so basically what it does is it it will store and forward ethernet frames"
"11-23","6:00","is similar to the router which also do a store forwarding IP datagrams right"
"11-23","6:06","um so the switch will examine the incoming frames Mac address and then"
"11-23","6:12","selectively forward the frame to one or more outgoing links okay so this is a"
"11-23","6:21","you keep in mind switch always switch always always work with the neighbors"
"11-23","6:27","the local area networks the the devices can directly connecting to it okay it"
"11-23","6:33","doesn't care about the other devices that are far away it only cares about"
"11-23","6:38","the devices that are directly connected to to it okay"
"11-23","6:45","um and switch is also transparent transparent here means the hosts are"
"11-23","6:51","unaware of the presence of switches they feel like they are communicating with"
"11-23","6:56","each other directly but they are going actually going through the switches okay and switches do not need to be"
"11-23","7:03","configured it is a plug and play it can do self learning so unions which is very"
"11-23","7:09","straightforward now we can look at this uh this example if we have for example here we have ABCD"
"11-23","7:18","uh sorry ABC a prime B Prime C Prime they are all connected to a switch"
"11-23","7:25","okay and this is which we all uh buffer the packets now"
"11-23","7:32","um you can see for example a can send package to a prime and B can send a"
"11-23","7:39","packet to B Prime they can send together okay they can send uh transmit simultaneously there there is no"
"11-23","7:46","clearance okay there's no cleaner don't worry about completing but if we are using the bus kind of structure then we"
"11-23","7:53","will have clearance okay and then you may ask how does the switch"
"11-23","7:59","know that a prime is reachable while this interface 4 and B Prime is"
"11-23","8:06","reachable y interface y how does the switch know that when a switch receives a packet how does the"
"11-23","8:13","space switch know which outgoing link to send so this is a question this is a question"
"11-23","8:20","we asked ourselves when we learn about the routing right the routers we know"
"11-23","8:27","the routers is generating a local forwarding table that local forwarding table is able to"
"11-23","8:33","decide help decide which Auto green link this package should be forwarded to"
"11-23","8:39","right so for switch for switch it also has some kind of forwarding people"
"11-23","8:46","but it's different from router for router we know the local forward table is generated by running a routing"
"11-23","8:53","algorithm right so for switch the local forwarding table the forward table is"
"11-23","8:59","actually generated through self-learning okay so what does this mean"
"11-23","9:05","so the switch also has a as I mentioned it also has a table here"
"11-23","9:10","okay it's very similar to a routine table"
"11-23","9:16","okay but it generally this table through self-learning self-learning basically"
"11-23","9:22","means switch will learn which horse can be reached through which interfaces"
"11-23","9:29","gradually okay um so for example for example let's see"
"11-23","9:35","now a is sending a frame to a prime you can see the source is a a destination is"
"11-23","9:44","a prime okay now it will send this one to the switch"
"11-23","9:51","okay see you can see this packet is actually going through"
"11-23","9:56","this uh interface one right and then switch will learn oh okay"
"11-23","10:02","a is sending a frame through interface one so then a is reachable through"
"11-23","10:10","interface one okay so that is uh that is learned by"
"11-23","10:15","the switch and put into the switch table and the for each record we also have a"
"11-23","10:22","TTL sorry for that and then um after that after that we"
"11-23","10:31","know switch doesn't know how to reach a prime because there is no entry for a prime right so"
"11-23","10:41","now what can we do what we can do is basically you can say"
"11-23","10:47","the switch will broadcast this to everyone"
"11-23","10:52","excluding a okay except a so to everyone and say hey uh I'm going"
"11-23","11:01","to send this to a prime so who has this definition address of a"
"11-23","11:07","prime okay then in this case a prime will"
"11-23","11:12","reply right a prime will see hey that's my Mac address and I'm the one uh that should"
"11-23","11:21","accept this Frame so and then a prime will reply to a in"
"11-23","11:28","this case you can see a the switch learned this again the switch will learn okay a prime is"
"11-23","11:35","sending this through interface 4. okay so then this will be put into the"
"11-23","11:41","switch table so gradually switch we'll learn all of the mappings"
"11-23","11:49","okay and then this time because this Frame is going to a do we need to do"
"11-23","11:55","broadcasting again to everyone we do not right we don't need to because"
"11-23","12:02","now we already have A's interface Mutual interface right we know a can be"
"11-23","12:09","reached through interface one so then in this case we don't need to do any broadcasting then switch can directly"
"11-23","12:16","forward this to a this is called selectively send I'm just one link"
"11-23","12:22","okay um so that is uh that is just the one"
"11-23","12:29","switch in the situation where we have only one switch but if what if we have a"
"11-23","12:34","number of switches connecting together okay in this case"
"11-23","12:39","how can we how can the switch know how how to"
"11-23","12:44","forward the packet okay so for example if a wants to"
"11-23","12:50","forward this to G let's see how does S1 know uh"
"11-23","12:57","how to forward the the the packet so how does S1 know oh I need to forward this"
"11-23","13:03","to S4 and as for that for this to S3 and then s342j how do we know this path"
"11-23","13:11","the answer is actually still self learning okay so let me explain how this would work"
"11-23","13:18","again and we'll see oh I'm sending something to J okay"
"11-23","13:25","so then it's this this Frame will go to S1 S1 will say oh I don't know how to"
"11-23","13:33","reach J so I have to broadcast it to everybody okay now this Frame is"
"11-23","13:39","broadcast to BC and also S4 okay so as for receives this we know BMC won't"
"11-23","13:47","reply right because B and C is not J um and then S4 will say oh I do not know"
"11-23","13:54","how to reach J okay then I have to forward this to everybody so S4 we are"
"11-23","14:01","basically forward this to S2 and also S3 okay all the switches all the neighbors"
"11-23","14:07","and S2 will forward this to everybody"
"11-23","14:12","okay flooded to everybody because at Tuesday I don't know who is the how to reach G okay then we know D E and F"
"11-23","14:20","won't reply after I still received this Esther will"
"11-23","14:25","also forward this to j h and I okay so then in this case J will say oh"
"11-23","14:32","that is my frame okay then G will form a frame from J"
"11-23","14:40","to a and send it back okay so now S3 has learned S3 has"
"11-23","14:48","learned how to reach a through this interface okay so through the interface between S4"
"11-23","14:56","and S3 so as the reveal say oh okay I just need to send it back to S4"
"11-23","15:02","okay the S4 has also learned how to reach a from last communication right"
"11-23","15:09","so S4 will say oh okay if I want to reach a I need to only forward this to"
"11-23","15:15","this interface and as one of course also knows how to retrieve because they have"
"11-23","15:20","learned they have the switch table okay so this is uh this is the self"
"11-23","15:26","learning process and you can see how this um these uh switches learn and in the"
"11-23","15:33","future whenever we have any package going to a or J they oh no all this"
"11-23","15:39","which is we all know how to reach most of the levels at least S1 S1 and S3"
"11-23","15:45","knows how to reach a and j okay of"
"11-23","15:50","course S2 doesn't know but S2 can also forward this package to S4 and S4"
"11-23","15:55","already knows right any questions about this self learning"
"11-23","16:03","okay I hope this process is is from it's a straightforward to you"
"11-23","16:10","okay so I have explained this so I just um skip this slide"
"11-23","16:16","okay so as you can see in a real institutional Network we usually have"
"11-23","16:22","multiple switches connecting to each other you can see we may have"
"11-23","16:28","um one switch here another switch here here we have multiple switches and they are all connected to a much bigger"
"11-23","16:35","switch and then we may have also have those servers connecting to the switch"
"11-23","16:40","and finally all this this switch may be connected to the voucher okay do we have"
"11-23","16:47","multiple routers no we have only one big router to the external network but we"
"11-23","16:54","may have multiple switches so then this will form one local area network"
"11-23","17:01","okay so you may ask what is the difference between the ceviche and router this"
"11-23","17:09","sounds uh familiar right the the this seems to have they seem to have similar"
"11-23","17:15","functionalities um yes they have some similar similarities they both of them are doing"
"11-23","17:22","slow and forwarding okay still on the forwarding the routers will"
"11-23","17:28","um will store the datagrams and forward it the link layer the switch will store"
"11-23","17:34","the frame and forward it um but they are actually I live different layers voucher is a network"
"11-23","17:40","layer device okay it will only examine the network"
"11-23","17:46","layer headers it can only enter the network layer headers the switch is a link layer device okay it examine the"
"11-23","17:53","link layer headers and both of them have the forwarding tables okay the difference is that the"
"11-23","18:01","router will compute this forward table through routing algorithms as we have learned for example link State Amazon"
"11-23","18:07","okay um and it relies on IP address to to"
"11-23","18:14","determine the outgoing link and switch is different switch will generate the"
"11-23","18:20","look of the forwarding table using self learning right flooding and"
"11-23","18:26","self-learning and it's relies on the Mac address to determine the Africa unique"
"11-23","18:32","so you can see the difference so here you can see the switch has only two layers"
"11-23","18:38","physically or unlinklier but network has three layers okay frame uh physically or"
"11-23","18:45","nuclear Network layer the computers we know they all have five layers okay so"
"11-23","18:51","those are the difference um and I want you to know that the"
"11-23","18:57","similarities and differences between routers and switches I may also have test questions here in the final exam"
"11-23","19:05","okay and the next thing I want to discuss is"
"11-23","19:11","the windland okay um so we know now we know how the land"
"11-23","19:19","works right so we have for example a bunch of switches connected together"
"11-23","19:25","to a big switch and then connect it to the router okay so maybe this which this"
"11-23","19:33","switch is connecting all the computer science um computers and this is the electrical"
"11-23","19:39","engineering and this is the computer engineering okay but there is one problem now"
"11-23","19:46","so for example if you consider a computer science user"
"11-23","19:51","most of the office to electrical engineering"
"11-23","19:57","okay so one day one computer is moving physically physically moving"
"11-23","20:05","to a different office to the electron in your office but this user this computer science user"
"11-23","20:11","still wants to be connected to the Cs computer science switch"
"11-23","20:17","because we know the computer science which will do a broadcasting Etc to all"
"11-23","20:25","the computer science computers right so of course we still want this computer to be managed by computer science but"
"11-23","20:32","physically it is already in the double e then in this case what can we do"
"11-23","20:38","so what can we do um so we we all know uh each switch now is"
"11-23","20:46","like a single broadcasting right so all the layer two broadcast traffic like ARP"
"11-23","20:52","DCP Etc uh they must cross the entire line they also have some security and"
"11-23","20:58","privacy issues efficiencies Etc anyway the problem now becomes becomes"
"11-23","21:05","we still want this computer to be managed by computer science but it is"
"11-23","21:10","physically in double e what can we do okay um we make do we need we may need to"
"11-23","21:18","have like a cable a long cable [Music] um to connect this computer back to the"
"11-23","21:25","switch but it's not as very convenient right so then one solution to that is called"
"11-23","21:32","the waterline okay watch your local area network"
"11-23","21:38","okay so basically this this means the switch is supporting the water line"
"11-23","21:45","capabilities can be configured to Define multiple virtual lens over a single"
"11-23","21:52","physical line infrastructure okay so you can say for example here we have one big"
"11-23","21:59","switch this this is one physical switch"
"11-23","22:05","okay this switch is used to connect all the machines"
"11-23","22:12","okay including computer science and electrical engineering machines they are"
"11-23","22:17","all connected to this one single physical switch but we can create"
"11-23","22:25","two different water lines by specifying the pawn numbers so for example we can"
"11-23","22:32","see all right from port number one to eight the blue color one"
"11-23","22:37","okay they belong to One winner"
"11-23","22:43","okay then the the those Point numbers from 9 to 16 the yellow ones they belong"
"11-23","22:50","to another Villa okay so what does this mean this"
"11-23","22:55","basically means all those blue pores they can only connect with each other on"
"11-23","23:02","if they are the same color if they are different colors they cannot directly connect with each other"
"11-23","23:08","okay so that means when we do like broadcasting we can only broadcast to the same color"
"11-23","23:16","from one to eight or from nine to sixteen we cannot broadcast to everybody"
"11-23","23:21","okay so in this way we can virtually separate the devices chin to two"
"11-23","23:30","different waylands okay so it's like we are"
"11-23","23:36","um we have multiple virtual switches okay so it's like although although they are"
"11-23","23:43","connected to the same physical switch but it feels like they are connected to different"
"11-23","23:51","um switches okay it's like that then if one day if one day uh one computer moves"
"11-23","23:59","the office okay so for example"
"11-23","24:05","if this computer okay if this computer originally"
"11-23","24:11","um it was from computer science and now it is it it is moved to electrical"
"11-23","24:18","engineering office and we can still connect this to the big switch"
"11-23","24:23","okay but we can just configure and make this"
"11-23","24:29","color to be the yellow one so then in this case this computer still belongs to"
"11-23","24:35","the computer science wheel and not the electro engineering relay okay so that"
"11-23","24:40","by doing this we can enable the dynamic membership okay that means the post can be"
"11-23","24:47","dynamically assigned among the vlans okay so that means for the yellow color"
"11-23","24:53","when they do broadcasting they can reach to if this is 4 3 and this is four"
"11-23","25:02","then in this case if computer science want to do broadcasting they can reach to not only 9 to 16 but also uh the port"
"11-23","25:10","number three they can also reach this computer okay and then for these two different Slants"
"11-23","25:19","two wheelands we can connect them using a router okay we can connect them using"
"11-23","25:26","a launcher so um that's how we do that and sometimes"
"11-23","25:32","sometimes we may have multiple switches right so one big switch may not work may"
"11-23","25:39","not be sufficient we may have another big switch okay so in this case how can"
"11-23","25:45","we connect these two switches so very easy we just use some because it's trunk"
"11-23","25:51","port to carry the frames between um multiple physical switches okay so"
"11-23","25:58","for example we have connect 16 to 1 and then this is used to carry the frames"
"11-23","26:04","between different switches okay and we can still Define the colors uh in the"
"11-23","26:10","same way okay Define the vlans in the same way uh any questions"
"11-23","26:21","so the the uh we learn frame format is a little bit different"
"11-23","26:27","um so you can see there are some more information added here"
"11-23","26:33","okay by the winner ID field Etc so you don't need to know this this is just for"
"11-23","26:39","reference okay you don't need to know this for the test uh so for link virtualization we do not"
"11-23","26:46","talk about this in this class okay for data center networks you can snore"
"11-23","26:53","this Center is basically we are basically connecting uh a lot of servers"
"11-23","26:58","together a lot of hosts together right so tend to uh 100"
"11-23","27:04","000 hosts and these holes are openly often often closely coupled in close"
"11-23","27:11","proximity okay for example if we are using Amazon or YouTube or Google"
"11-23","27:17","whatever so those costs need to um provide service and also store the"
"11-23","27:24","data okay and then the challenge is we have multiple applications each serving"
"11-23","27:30","massive number of clients how can we manage the uh the workload how can we do"
"11-23","27:38","load balancing avoid like uh overwhelming one host or a number of"
"11-23","27:44","Hearts over the others right um so"
"11-23","27:50","why am I going to do that is using what we have learned uh using the switches"
"11-23","27:56","okay so um for example you can see here we have the broader uh border"
"11-23","28:03","um round structure and we also have the access routers then below that we may"
"11-23","28:08","have some switches okay so these are the tier one switch"
"11-23","28:13","and then we also have a tier 2 switch and the Tor switch to R means the top uh"
"11-23","28:21","on rack how those server"
"11-23","28:28","um wrecks okay so and there are something called load balancer load"
"11-23","28:34","balance are just normal computers okay uh they can run some algorithms those"
"11-23","28:40","load balancers are connected to the tier one switch the functionality for load"
"11-23","28:46","balancer is to receive the external client requests and then direct the"
"11-23","28:52","workload to different costs within the data center and then return the result to the"
"11-23","28:58","external client okay so basically the client cannot see a Data Center and"
"11-23","29:06","clients feel like it is only receiving the result from one server but it's actually from a data center okay"
"11-23","29:14","so you can see here the traffic is coming in it is going through a load"
"11-23","29:19","balancer okay the load balancer May distribute to this load to other machines"
"11-23","29:26","okay to other machines sometimes it may also need to connect to multiple servers"
"11-23","29:31","for example we may have for example if this is a like this is a web server and"
"11-23","29:38","this may be a data speed server okay the website when we need to query"
"11-23","29:43","the database server to get the results and then the result will be returned back to maps around the"
"11-23","29:50","web part so we will reply um to the client so this is the entire"
"11-23","29:55","process and then with the load balancer and the switches Etc we can assign the"
"11-23","30:01","workload to different uh computer different Hots so that we do not overwhelm just one person"
"11-23","30:08","in the one machine sorry okay and there is a rich interconnection among the"
"11-23","30:13","switches and drugs uh this can increase the throughput between the Rocks okay"
"11-23","30:19","and also of course increase the reliability uh through redundancy because we have redundant machines as"
"11-23","30:26","backup if one machine is down and we have other servers to come up and work"
"11-23","30:32","okay five-point assignment is"
"11-28","0:03","the five-point assignment is like a summary of what we have learned so far"
"11-28","0:09","from chapter 1 to chapter five okay I hope we can review what we have covered"
"11-28","0:16","and give you like a whole picture of what we have learned okay"
"11-28","0:22","so basically um today we are going to look at a day in"
"11-28","0:28","the life of a web request okay it's like a story okay and next story"
"11-28","0:34","um and we want to look at every every layer we want to when we make a web"
"11-28","0:40","request we want to see what what is happening behind the scene okay"
"11-28","0:45","um for you probably when you use web browser you what you do is you only click on a button and then you you are"
"11-28","0:52","you are done right so you type in the URL you hit enter and then you are"
"11-28","0:58","waiting for the webpage but there are actually a lot of things happening behind the scene and we want to learn"
"11-28","1:05","what is happening okay what is the entire process okay"
"11-28","1:11","so basically our goal is to put it all together we call this as synthesis okay"
"11-28","1:18","so the goal is to identify review and understand all the protocols at all"
"11-28","1:24","layers involved in a simile um simple scenario so basically the"
"11-28","1:30","scenario is very easy a student attaches a laptop to the campus Network and then"
"11-28","1:38","make a request of google.com very simple scenario okay let's see what is"
"11-28","1:45","happening so firstly you can see uh this this is the Comcast network this is the"
"11-28","1:52","school network okay this is the web server and this is Google's network of course this web server belongs to Google"
"11-28","1:58","okay this is Google's web server and now we assume a laptop is connecting"
"11-28","2:06","to this machine connecting to this network school network okay and then uh we the student"
"11-28","2:13","then open the web browser and try to request google.com then of course what"
"11-28","2:20","will happen is uh Google's web server will return a web page right to the"
"11-28","2:26","students computer so this is a very simple scenario but actually yes"
"11-28","2:33","um from what we have learned before we know there are actually a lot of things happening"
"11-28","2:38","so first thing first thing keeping in mind when this computer joins the"
"11-28","2:44","network does this computer has uh have a IP address"
"11-28","2:50","it does not it does not have an IP address so it needs to firstly request"
"11-28","2:57","an IP address okay so how do we request the IP address"
"11-28","3:06","we all know that we have learned DHCP right the function of DCP protocol is"
"11-28","3:13","basically providing IP address to a newly joined computer"
"11-28","3:18","okay so then in this case we know in this case we know this computer"
"11-28","3:25","is making a dtcp request okay making a dtcp request and we know"
"11-28","3:33","that for dtcp it is application layer protocol and now pay attention we want to look at each"
"11-28","3:40","layer what what is the protocol used okay for application layer it is d2cp"
"11-28","3:46","for transport layer when it comes down to transport layer we"
"11-28","3:52","know we need to add a header transport layer header and this transport this transport layer"
"11-28","3:58","the protocol we we used should be UDP"
"11-28","4:03","not TCP so we haven't learned this before right I have explained why we should use only"
"11-28","4:12","UDP not TCP because current for TCP we know we need to establish a connection"
"11-28","4:18","between the source and the destination but here this computer itself does not"
"11-28","4:25","have any IP address yet and also it doesn't know who is the DHCP server who"
"11-28","4:32","is the destination okay so that's why it cannot make a TCP"
"11-28","4:37","connection that's why we have to use UDP so here I may have a test question"
"11-28","4:43","I will ask you what is the protocol used as the application layer what is the"
"11-28","4:48","protocol used at the transport layer so you should know those okay and then when"
"11-28","4:54","it comes down to a layer below we know we will use IP protocol right"
"11-28","5:00","um and then of course here we haven't started any like routine kind"
"11-28","5:06","of things yet but we will for sure add the source and destination IP address"
"11-28","5:11","okay and then it comes down the link layer if we are using ethernet okay then"
"11-28","5:17","we will use uh uh ethernet protocol okay the protocol for ethernet so you can see"
"11-28","5:23","uh finally then this packet comes down to physically here okay"
"11-28","5:28","and then next we know we know this this Frame"
"11-28","5:35","okay finally this Frame will be sent to the dtcp server but as we mentioned"
"11-28","5:43","we don't know who is the server yet okay so in this case what should we do"
"11-28","5:48","we actually we learned when we talk about the gcp we learned we should send"
"11-28","5:54","this to everybody this is called broadcasting right we should broadcast this message to everybody in this"
"11-28","6:01","network so then who how do we do the broadcasting we do broadcasting at"
"11-28","6:08","ethernet at the lower layer the link layer we know if we want to do the broadcasting we have to use the address"
"11-28","6:15","our 12 F's okay 12 F's on the left"
"11-28","6:22","okay so if the if this if we do broadcasting at the"
"11-28","6:27","um as the network layer we should use 255.255"
"11-28","6:41",".255.255 This Is How We Do broadcasting as the network layer so Network layer basically will specify the destination"
"11-28","6:48","address as a uh 255.255.255.255 but at the link layer if"
"11-28","6:55","we if we want to do broadcasting then we need to use 12 apps as the MAC address"
"11-28","7:01","as destination methodless okay I hope everything is clear so far okay then"
"11-28","7:08","after that we know uh the dtcb server will receive this message this request"
"11-28","7:15","and then begin to formulate a reply okay of course we know actually they're on a"
"11-28","7:22","number of uh back and forth Communications here but here we to"
"11-28","7:27","simplify the problem we just look at the last one okay how the dtcp server"
"11-28","7:34","formulated the reply the dtp server will basically a reply with"
"11-28","7:42","a message which contains the client's IP address"
"11-28","7:48","okay the IP address of the first hop router to remember"
"11-28","7:54","we have mentioned this for multiple times okay and also the name and IP"
"11-28","8:00","address our DNS server and if you remember we also have Network"
"11-28","8:05","mask okay so those are the information that"
"11-28","8:12","will be included in the reply message in the response message okay so the reason"
"11-28","8:18","that we want to provide not only the client IP address but also the other"
"11-28","8:24","information such as photo router IP address DNS IP address Network mask Etc"
"11-28","8:30","is basically introducing the network to this new camera okay to"
"11-28","8:37","this new camera so that's in the future this this computer will know who to contact okay so there you can see the"
"11-28","8:45","reply message is formulated and of course we are using UDP again okay at"
"11-28","8:52","the transport layer and the IP ethernet Fisk layer okay so"
"11-28","8:58","um so then you may ask how does this this switch"
"11-28","9:04","how does this switch know which link to forward you when this"
"11-28","9:12","packet comes in this Frame comes in the switch needs to forward it to this"
"11-28","9:18","new coming new camera right new computer then how does the switch know that we"
"11-28","9:25","should forward this to listening okay we actually have learned the switch"
"11-28","9:32","has a capability called self learning right self-learning then basically the"
"11-28","9:39","switch will have a table"
"11-28","9:48","a table called switch table okay in this switch table it will have the MAC address"
"11-28","9:58","the MAC address and the link output link um pair okay then so gradually the"
"11-28","10:06","switch will learn which Mac address is corresponding to which link so the"
"11-28","10:12","switch will know how to reach that computer okay so this is another thing you should keep in mind self-learning"
"11-28","10:22","okay so now now the client has"
"11-28","10:29","most of the information that it needs IP address its own IP address"
"11-28","10:34","the name and address of the DS server and the IP address of its first Hub"
"11-28","10:40","browser later we will know the first half router is also very important okay"
"11-28","10:47","so then the next thing is okay we want to send out the ATP request"
"11-28","10:55","right but we only know currently we only know google.com do we know the IP address of"
"11-28","11:03","google.com yet we do not know okay so then we have to use another protocol"
"11-28","11:09","called DNS okay DNS to make a request"
"11-28","11:15","to to get the IP address for google.com then in this case in this case again"
"11-28","11:20","okay uh we will application layer we will formulate a request that is the DS"
"11-28","11:27","request okay when it comes down to transport layer again we will add a header okay"
"11-28","11:32","and now you can see the transport layer is also using UDP"
"11-28","11:38","then it's also using UDP so here for DNS we can use TCP because we already know"
"11-28","11:47","um the DS server the DN server is IP address okay but"
"11-28","11:54","usually we we use UDP the major reason is is for uh is because UDP is much"
"11-28","12:01","faster okay it's much faster right we does not need to uh spend time on making"
"11-28","12:07","connections okay and we uh the UDP packet is also very lightweight we know"
"11-28","12:12","it has a much shorter header okay so we want to get this result as soon as"
"11-28","12:18","possible so that's the main reason we use UDP here at transport layer again okay so the lower layers are similar IP"
"11-28","12:27","ethernet and then physical layer okay um"
"11-28","12:33","but here we have a question so firstly we established the DNS query okay we"
"11-28","12:39","create this query and this is in cabinet encapsulating eodp"
"11-28","12:45","um in IP and ethernet then the next thing is we want to send this Frame to"
"11-28","12:51","the router okay we need to send this Frame to the to the router okay"
"11-28","12:58","and then now we need the MAC address of the"
"11-28","13:04","router right so we need the MAC address of the router if we want to send our frame to"
"11-28","13:12","it we all we know that we know that this router is actually the first Hub router"
"11-28","13:26","so pay attention you know some of you may ask why do we need to send this Frame to browser"
"11-28","13:31","because we know that the answer if you come back to"
"11-28","13:39","if you come back to this topology the DN server is actually in the Comcast"
"11-28","13:46","network and now this computer is in the school network okay so of course we will"
"11-28","13:53","need to send this to the first Hub router and then the first hole browser will forward the message for us to the"
"11-28","14:00","DN server and to to um to get the IP address for Google okay"
"11-28","14:06","so that's why we must contact this first Hub browser"
"11-28","14:11","and we already know the uh if we want to"
"11-28","14:17","contact this router we need to know the MAC address for this router right but now we already know the IP address for"
"11-28","14:25","this launcher how do we know so here I may ask you a question in the test how do you mean know the IP address"
"11-28","14:32","for this purpose of router and from what we have discussed here actually we know"
"11-28","14:42","how do we get that we gotta throw DHCP actually okay because DHCP protocol has"
"11-28","14:49","returned the IP address of the first up router that's how we get to learn about"
"11-28","14:55","this okay and now with this first hop"
"11-28","15:00","router's IP address okay so"
"11-28","15:05","so here let me"
"11-28","15:28","so our assumption here is we already know the IP address of the first hop"
"11-28","15:35","launcher how do we know we know the answer is DHCP okay we get to know this"
"11-28","15:41","through gcp and then the next thing is okay we now know the IP address of the"
"11-28","15:47","router that how do we know the MAC address of this router"
"11-28","15:52","so I want you to review what we have learned last time recall what we have learned last time if we already know the"
"11-28","15:59","id address of one interface if we want to know the I the MAC address for that"
"11-28","16:06","the corresponding Mac address then what we need to do is actually very easy"
"11-28","16:11","it's just uh using ARP right ARP address resolution protocol so what if they are"
"11-28","16:18","within the same line if they are within the same land then what we need to do is simply shouting to everybody simply"
"11-28","16:26","doing the broadcasting right so then basically this computer will send out an"
"11-28","16:32","Erp query to everybody asking say hey who has this IP address okay then that"
"11-28","16:40","router with this I uh IP address will reply with the MAC address with its own"
"11-28","16:49","Mac address okay so this is the ARP part okay uh and in the test in the final"
"11-28","16:56","exam I may ask you a question so how could the uh if the this is if this"
"11-28","17:03","computer wants to send a frame to the first Hub router then it needs the MAC address of firstcode browser so how"
"11-28","17:10","could this computer know the MAC address of this first Hub browser then you know the answer is actually Federal ARP okay"
"11-28","17:19","and then now we know the MAC address so then we can go ahead to send out the DNS query"
"11-28","17:26","okay the DNS query and okay we all also"
"11-28","17:32","know this DNS query will not stop here at the router it has to go through"
"11-28","17:39","um the network and finally reach the DS right and we also know if we want to"
"11-28","17:46","um know the MAC address of this DNS server okay we need to go through"
"11-28","17:53","also the Erp query right also the ARP query and we also know uh in this"
"11-28","18:00","process we actually need to change at this point okay at this point we need to change the"
"11-28","18:06","MAC address okay you you think about the sauce the"
"11-28","18:13","sauce mag"
"11-28","18:41","okay so when the frame leaves this computer okay now I use m1m2m through M4"
"11-28","18:49","to represent the MAC address for these different interfaces okay we know when"
"11-28","18:55","this when this Frame leaves the first computer okay the source Mac address is"
"11-28","19:01","actually M1 destination Mac address is actually M2 okay how do we know M2 we just we just"
"11-28","19:09","discussed we we do this through ARP query right and then"
"11-28","19:25","and then when the frame comes to here the the source"
"11-28","19:32","Max now becomes M third"
"11-28","19:47","uh actually it's even more complicated okay it's even more complicated now"
"11-28","19:54","because we have to go through two routers it's not just a wine router okay not just one router so then the"
"11-28","20:00","destination Mac is now has to be this Mac okay and then with this router will"
"11-28","20:05","have to change it again from uh this this Mac to this map so they say let's"
"11-28","20:11","see if this is M4 M4 M5 M6 okay this can be m"
"11-28","20:19","four okay um"
"11-28","20:24","and then here we need to make the MAC address as a source as M5"
"11-28","20:31","then destination as a M6 okay so uh but here for this part I will"
"11-28","20:40","not test you because this is getting more complicated um let's see I'll just erase this part"
"11-28","20:47","to make it easier to understand"
"11-28","20:56","okay uh but but if you still want to review okay if you want to have a better"
"11-28","21:03","understanding you'd better come back to the ARP protocol we have learned before"
"11-28","21:09","okay and um this this actually this slide"
"11-28","21:14","addresses the problem of routing to another uh lamp Okay how do we change"
"11-28","21:20","the MAC address so review that part again to have a better understanding but"
"11-28","21:26","anyway here here okay uh I will test you to that that depth the only thing you"
"11-28","21:32","need to know is actually within same line we know we have to send an Erp query then if we want to go across"
"11-28","21:40","different lines okay we also need to send out the ARP query"
"11-28","21:45","okay and then"
"11-28","21:53","okay we also need to send out the Erp query but but finally finally okay"
"11-28","22:00","finally this DNS requests need to be sent to the DN server okay and then in"
"11-28","22:06","this process in this process we need we know the router has to do some routine okay and then here is uh where we want"
"11-28","22:16","we want to consider the routine protocol so what kind of routing protocol can we use so we have learned the the internet"
"11-28","22:24","routine and the intra as routine right so for example for intra is routing we"
"11-28","22:31","learned the bgp we know there is ibdp and ebdp so they have different"
"11-28","22:37","um functions right so for EDP ebgp we"
"11-28","22:42","know it is using to it is used to learn reachability information"
"11-28","22:48","ipdp is then used to propagate the reachability information to everybody"
"11-28","22:54","inside this local area network okay that is a bgt then for OS for the intro as"
"11-28","23:01","routine protocol we know we can use ospf okay so those are the protocols that we"
"11-28","23:07","have learned for round team so here I want I want you to know only ospf and BJP"
"11-28","23:14","um and then finally this cancer will received this uh uh this DNS query and"
"11-28","23:20","you can see the headers are removed layer by layer finally the application"
"11-28","23:26","layer has the DS query then it will form a response"
"11-28","23:31","okay one more response and reply to the computer to the client the IP address of"
"11-28","23:39","google.com so now finally we get the IP address of"
"11-28","23:44","google.com okay then the next thing we need to do is okay now I have the IP address then"
"11-28","23:53","we can finally send out the HTTP request right so then you can see the computer"
"11-28","23:59","now forms a HTTP request and then a weight comes down to the transport layer"
"11-28","24:05","okay we know we must use TCP the reason is because we need"
"11-28","24:11","reliability okay we want this request to be sent without any error okay and of course"
"11-28","24:19","before we do data exchange we have learned this for many times"
"11-28","24:25","before we do this exchange we need to firstly establish a connection how do we"
"11-28","24:31","establish the connection we do three-way handshake do you still remember that okay we do three hashing to establish a"
"11-28","24:38","connection this is actually an extra step compared to UDP for UDP we do not"
"11-28","24:45","need to do any three hashing right we do not need to establish any uh connection"
"11-28","24:51","but for TCP for TCP we have to establish the connection"
"11-28","24:56","um so how do we do the three hatching we we know we firstly set the same into one"
"11-28","25:04","okay such thing into one and the AC key equal to zero"
"11-28","25:10","okay then the other side will reply with"
"11-28","25:20","with uh sorry with c equal to 1 AC equals to one okay"
"11-28","25:27","then finally we will have a confirmation from the client with"
"11-28","25:36","c equal to 0 is equal to one that's how we establish the connection okay"
"11-28","25:42","and then you can see this is sent this is sent this is actually the first step"
"11-28","25:47","this is sent to the server okay this is the first step sent to the server uh and"
"11-28","25:53","then the silver will formulate sing a c k okay this is the second step actually"
"11-28","26:00","this is this one"
"11-28","26:27","just this is the scene ack uh reply okay"
"11-28","26:32","and sorry it's too fast then it is sent back so you can see the client"
"11-28","26:39","um remove the headers layer by layer and actually there is another one finally"
"11-28","26:44","finally um uh the client will also confirm again with c equal to 0 AC k equal to one okay"
"11-28","26:52","this is the three-way handshake uh and then we know the TCP connection now"
"11-28","26:57","established okay so as a final step now the HTTP request"
"11-28","27:03","can be sent out okay and we add headers at each layer and we are using TCP and then this is"
"11-28","27:11","set to the server the server remove all the headers extracted HTTP request and"
"11-28","27:19","then finally form a response with the requested web page okay so then this is"
"11-28","27:28","this HTTP response actually has actually has the web page"
"11-28","27:34","in the data right so this is a response message it's a send back to the client"
"11-28","27:39","and finally the client now can remove all the headers lead by layer and then"
"11-28","27:46","extract the web page and display it on the web browser so this is the final step"
"11-28","27:52","um okay so that is uh the day in the live for the HTTP request and reply"
"11-28","27:59","uh actually you can see uh this is a this is a really long process right so if we summarize"
"11-28","28:07","the first step is DHCP the DCP is mainly used for getting the IP address for the"
"11-28","28:14","client and also get some information about the network for example the first"
"11-28","28:20","half routers IP address uh the IP address for the DS server and the network mask Etc okay so those are the"
"11-28","28:28","information that we get through the hcp server um and then the second protocol we use"
"11-28","28:34","is actually uh DNS because knowing only Google's"
"11-28","28:41","um hostname is not enough we need the IP address for this computer that's why we"
"11-28","28:47","need to um send out another DNS query"
"11-28","28:53","um and then finally we do HTTP okay then we"
"11-28","28:58","can send out the HTTP request and of course before the HTTP request we need to establish a connection first right"
"11-28","29:05","through Theory handshake um and then at lower layer at lower layer we know a lot of things has"
"11-28","29:11","happened for example how do we do broadcasting we use"
"11-28","29:17","um uh if it's Network layer we use 255 255 25"
"11-28","29:23","as the IP address if it's link layer we use 12 apps as the MAC address right"
"11-28","29:29","that's how we do the broadcasting and how could the switch now"
"11-28","29:34","um which outputting to choose to send we know the switch has a switch table and"
"11-28","29:41","how do we get the sweet table we use self learning right"
"11-28","29:47","um and also sometimes we know the IP address of the first home browser okay"
"11-28","29:52","or some computer some other IP address so then we need to know the MAC address"
"11-28","29:59","for that interface how do we know the MAC address we know we we can use ARP"
"11-28","30:05","query so you can see a lot of information is contained in this one complete story one scenario a lot of"
"11-28","30:14","information and I really hope I really hope you can go back to review what we have learned"
"11-28","30:22","today and kind of synthesize uh all the different layers and make this story"
"11-28","30:28","complete okay and then in the final exam I will definitely have a question about"
"11-28","30:34","this okay I'll be I will ask you what are the protocols used at each layer"
"11-28","30:41","um how do how does the sweet table be generated how is the switch table be"
"11-28","30:47","generated or how could the switch know which output link to send okay how do we do broadcasting okay or uh if you do not"
"11-28","30:56","know the IP address and how do you send this package to the"
"11-28","31:02","destination okay we know we have to do broadcasting sometimes so"
"11-28","31:07","uh and also I may ask you something about the ARP query so a lot of things I"
"11-28","31:13","will ask so really please review what we have learned today okay"
"11-30","0:05","okay so chapter six is about network security network security is the last"
"11-30","0:11","chapter in our entire semester basically in this chapter we try to understand the"
"11-30","0:17","principles of network security including the cryptography authentication message Integrity"
"11-30","0:25","Etc and we will also talk about the security practice for example how can we"
"11-30","0:31","deploy firewalls and electricity systems what are the mechanisms behind them and"
"11-30","0:38","um what are the security or how are the security deployed in application"
"11-30","0:43","transport Network and ink layers Etc so this is an outline of the entire"
"11-30","0:49","chapter first let's look at the question what is network security"
"11-30","0:57","basically in our security there are three major principles we call it as CIA"
"11-30","1:05","so C stands for confidentiality"
"11-30","1:14","I stands for integrity foreign"
"11-30","1:20","a stand for availability"
"11-30","1:29","so you will learn about this three principles again in csc154"
"11-30","1:37","now let me briefly explain what the those principles are firstly"
"11-30","1:42","confidentiality so this means only the sender and the receiver should"
"11-30","1:49","understand the message contents so this message should be confidential to"
"11-30","1:56","um only the sender and the receiver okay so then in order to ensure the"
"11-30","2:01","confidentiality usually we need the senders to encrypt the message and the receiver to decrypt the message okay so"
"11-30","2:08","that is the computationality then the next thing is the Integrity so"
"11-30","2:15","Integrity We have basically two aspects one aspect is the source Integrity which"
"11-30","2:23","means we need to make sure this message is indeed sent by somebody okay it's not"
"11-30","2:30","by anybody else it's indeed by this person or this computer or this router"
"11-30","2:35","okay so for that what we do usually is we need to do authentication okay so"
"11-30","2:42","authentication is basically used to ensure or enforce the source"
"11-30","2:51","integrity okay"
"11-30","2:56","so that in this case we need the sender and receiver confirm the identity of"
"11-30","3:02","each other then the second aspect of the Integrity is actually content Integrity"
"11-30","3:09","which means we want to ensure the message is not altered the message"
"11-30","3:17","itself the content of the message is not ordered during the transition or after"
"11-30","3:24","the transition okay so those are the two aspects of Integrity you think about this again"
"11-30","3:32","firstly Source integrity and then we have content Integrity okay the last"
"11-30","3:37","thing is availability availability means the resources or the"
"11-30","3:44","services must be accessible and available to the users okay so you think"
"11-30","3:51","about the denial service attack we talked about in chapter one right so basically"
"11-30","3:58","for that attack it makes the resources or the services and available to"
"11-30","4:04","legitimate users now in this case we say oh okay availability is not there anymore okay okay so those are the three"
"11-30","4:14","um principles of network security I hope you keep this in mind confidentiality integrity and availability okay"
"11-30","4:22","and later we will discuss how to ensure the this three principles uh using some"
"11-30","4:31","security matters okay all right so before we talk more about"
"11-30","4:38","security like firstly introduce uh some K roles in security words okay"
"11-30","4:45","so Alice ball and Trudy these three people are really famous in the network"
"11-30","4:52","security community so firstly n is an above are two users okay because for"
"11-30","4:59","example they can be lowers okay they want to communicate securely"
"11-30","5:04","but we may have some intruder such as Judy okay who may intercept delayed or"
"11-30","5:13","add messages into the communication between Alice and above so here you can"
"11-30","5:19","see Alice and Bob has some data they want to communicate okay but the"
"11-30","5:25","truly May do something bad in the middle okay so keep this in mind we will use"
"11-30","5:33","these three rows again again and you may ask who can be Alice in one"
"11-30","5:41","okay in real life in real life Alison and Bob can be anybody can be any"
"11-30","5:49","regular users or they can be with the web parameters"
"11-30","5:55","and clients okay they can be the online banking"
"11-30","6:01","client and server two machines they can be the DN servers and the clients"
"11-30","6:07","or they even be between the DN servers they can be the routers okay so they can"
"11-30","6:14","be a lot of things they don't have to be the real person they can be two machines to devices keep"
"11-30","6:22","this in mind and then for truly what can truly do"
"11-30","6:28","what can a bad guy do the better guy can actually do a lot of things if you"
"11-30","6:34","recall what we have learned in chapter one okay the bad guy can"
"11-30","6:39","do abstract for example he or she can interest at the messages"
"11-30","6:45","he or she can also insert new message or wrong message or fake"
"11-30","6:51","messages into the connection right he or she can also impersonate somebody"
"11-30","6:57","else they can do eyepiece spoofing email spoofing they can fake The Source"
"11-30","7:04","address in the package they can also do hijacking hijacking means basically to"
"11-30","7:09","take over an ongoing Connection by removing either the sender or receiver"
"11-30","7:15","and then inserting himself in place we have a very famous attack called session"
"11-30","7:22","hijacking in security and the bad guy can also do the Nile"
"11-30","7:27","service which means prevent the service from being used by others okay we have"
"11-30","7:33","discussed this before and then after we learn the network"
"11-30","7:39","security the basic knowledge I want to introduce the principles of"
"11-30","7:46","cryptography because that is like the foundation for network security without"
"11-30","7:52","cryptography we cannot do anything to network security okay so only with the foundation of"
"11-30","8:00","crypto cryptography and then we can deploy a lot of different mechanisms to"
"11-30","8:08","help us achieve the CIA confidentiality integrity and availability okay"
"11-30","8:15","all right so firstly let's look at the language for cryptography"
"11-30","8:21","in cryptography unfortunately need to know plan text and then you should know save for text"
"11-30","8:29","so ciphertext is generated by encrypting"
"11-30","8:35","the plain text with an encryption algorithm and an encryption k"
"11-30","8:42","so we use Ka to represent Alice's encryption K after the ciphertext is"
"11-30","8:49","generated it will be sent to Bob the recipient"
"11-30","8:54","then the resentment will decrypt this ciphertext with the decryption algorithm"
"11-30","9:02","and also Bob's decryption k which is KB"
"11-30","9:08","and eventually it will generate the plain text okay so here we use M to represent the"
"11-30","9:16","plain text message and then we can use Kam"
"11-30","9:23","to represent the ciphertext which is generated by"
"11-30","9:29","encrypting the message with the K of a"
"11-30","9:35","or the K of Alice the encryption k o l is okay and then for the decryption we"
"11-30","9:44","can do this which means we can use this is the cipher text right the km is the"
"11-30","9:51","cycle text then we can use KB the decryption K to decrypt"
"11-30","9:59","the ciphertext and then generate the plain text message M so these are the"
"11-30","10:07","language we will use for cryptography and later you will we will use it again"
"11-30","10:12","and again so personally for cryptography let's talk"
"11-30","10:20","about the symmetric key cryptography it's actually a very natural thing when"
"11-30","10:25","you talk about the cryptography or the encryption decryption it's a very"
"11-30","10:31","natural to think oh the the encryption K and the"
"11-30","10:36","decrement K can be the same right so in this case um we say Bob and Alice share the same k"
"11-30","10:45","then we call this as symmetric take cryptography that means the K is known to both Alice"
"11-30","10:54","and above okay um so you may ask how to Bob and Alice"
"11-30","11:02","agree on the K value this is actually a very important question because we want to"
"11-30","11:09","um not only ensure the message is confidential right we also want to"
"11-30","11:16","ensure the K itself is confidential so in the old days people usually"
"11-30","11:22","exchange this uh um encryption and decoration K face to face"
"11-30","11:29","okay the the meat for example meeting at some place physically and then they"
"11-30","11:35","exchange the K so then later they can use the k for secure communication"
"11-30","11:40","that's usually what they do yeah let's look at an example of"
"11-30","11:47","the symmetric K cryptography so it's a very uh simple"
"11-30","11:53","scheme for example here we can say this is one type"
"11-30","11:58","substitution Cipher which means we can substitute one thing for another thing"
"11-30","12:06","okay here in this example you can see this is a mono alphabetic Cipher which"
"11-30","12:13","means we substitute one letter for another letter so in this example you can see this is the plain text we have"
"11-30","12:19","ABCD to the 26 letters and then these 26 letters"
"11-30","12:27","will be replaced one by a man for example a can be replaced to M inside"
"11-30","12:32","for text B can replace the two n inside for text okay then with this with this mapping"
"11-30","12:42","then the plane if the plain text is above I love you Alice this can be"
"11-30","12:49","encrypted into nkn Etc as the cipher text so basically B is replaced to n"
"11-30","12:58","oh as you can see it's replaced to K B is replaced to n again so it's a very"
"11-30","13:05","easy substitution okay um so this is actually already uh"
"11-30","13:11","Advanced version of a substitution Cipher uh originally when people firstly"
"11-30","13:18","design the substitution Cipher the one very simple way is"
"11-30","13:24","um replace a letter with a letter that is behind"
"11-30","13:29","so for example we may we may say a can be replaced with the same B can be"
"11-30","13:35","replaced with d and c can be replaced with e it's like that okay or of course"
"11-30","13:40","you can say a can be replaced with f and B can be replaced with G C can be"
"11-30","13:48","replaced with h it is also fine okay but anyway you can see no matter"
"11-30","13:54","how this is done these are all the substitution ciphers"
"11-30","14:00","okay these are all called the substitution ciphers um so this is a very easy way but of"
"11-30","14:07","course you can see it's very simple and it's me it may not be very reliable"
"11-30","14:13","um for example there are many different ways for analyzing the ciphertext"
"11-30","14:20","if for example if somebody else gets this type of text"
"11-30","14:26","and he or she can analyze the fire Cipher text by using statistics for"
"11-30","14:32","example and then say Oh okay the most commonly used letter in English is let's"
"11-30","14:38","say t okay then by analyzing all the"
"11-30","14:43","cipher texts statistically then he can guess oh okay T is replaced into"
"11-30","14:50","you okay so it's like that so there are some ways to decrypt this and also uh if"
"11-30","14:58","for example the uh somebody somebody know okay this message is about Bob and"
"11-30","15:05","Alice and they may guess oh okay Alice this is the name of Alice and then very"
"11-30","15:12","likely Alice is interpreted into this then he or she immediately knows a is"
"11-30","15:19","replaced with m l is replaced with the G7 so you can see these are all the ways"
"11-30","15:25","uh to guess the potential substitution that's why this kind of a scheme is"
"11-30","15:32","actually not very reliable okay and in this case you can see the"
"11-30","15:37","encryption k is actually the mapping"
"11-30","15:42","okay this mapping from the set of alternative clusters to another set of"
"11-30","15:48","26 letters is the encryption K okay this encryption K will be shared by the"
"11-30","15:56","sender and the receiver okay because this substitution Cipher is not"
"11-30","16:04","that um reliable that's why uh nowadays we"
"11-30","16:10","are using more advanced symmetric key cryptos like DS data encryption standard"
"11-30","16:16","so this is um uh d e s is actually we"
"11-30","16:22","call it block Cipher which means it is actually using a 56-bit symmetric key"
"11-30","16:30","okay and um the plain text is divided into"
"11-30","16:37","64-bit input and then the inclusion is down"
"11-30","16:43","in units of blocks okay so how secure is DS"
"11-30","16:48","uh in the DS challenge you can see the 56-bit encrypted phrase can be decrypted"
"11-30","16:56","in less than a day so it's not very secure actually okay in order to make"
"11-30","17:02","this more secure um people also designed 3DS which means we"
"11-30","17:09","increase it three times with three different case 40 years to make this"
"11-30","17:14","more secure okay and um in addition to that"
"11-30","17:22","people also designed AES which is Advanced encryption standards so this"
"11-30","17:29","now has already become the new standard for a symmetric key it has replaced Des"
"11-30","17:40","the data are processed in 128 bit blocks so for the case it can be 108 bits"
"11-30","17:48","192-bit or 256 bit if you compare DS and AES"
"11-30","17:56","The Brute Force decryption takes only one second on the yes but it"
"11-30","18:03","needs to take 149 trillion years for AES as you can see ESL is actually much more secure"
"11-30","18:11","than DS okay um"
"11-30","18:16","so that you may ask does the symmetric encryption surface"
"11-30","18:23","is it good enough we see symmetric encryption is usually"
"11-30","18:29","very fast but it has limitation you think about this so the first limitation is that this K is known by both the"
"11-30","18:39","sender and the receiver as we said"
"11-30","18:45","we want to the center and the receiver to agree with this case but how can we"
"11-30","18:51","distribute to the K right of course we can say oh they can meet"
"11-30","18:57","personally choose change the K that's fine but that's not efficient especially if we"
"11-30","19:03","are doing everything online right so the K distribution and agreement is very"
"11-30","19:09","vulnerable the second thing is the K is not attached with identity"
"11-30","19:17","that means if the sender and the receiver assembly fight with each other"
"11-30","19:22","the receiver will say hey the sender has disclosed some information"
"11-30","19:28","but how can we prove that we cannot right so the center can simply deny that"
"11-30","19:35","that's that's the that because this key is shared by both the sender and the"
"11-30","19:40","receiver so they can easily deny something they have already done okay so that is uh"
"11-30","19:48","actually against something we call as non-reputation okay"
"11-30","19:54","so this this is a one aspect the second aspect is the K management"
"11-30","20:00","management problem that means when Alice wants to securely communicate with a"
"11-30","20:07","large number of people or a large number of receivers then Alice needs to remember or manage a"
"11-30","20:16","large number of kids that is sometimes can become very com very complex for for Alice okay so those"
"11-30","20:25","are the two limitations for symmetric encryption"
"11-30","20:32","um so we have mentioned this right how can"
"11-30","20:37","they agree on the K in first place um with those limitations then people"
"11-30","20:45","finally designed something called public key cryptography publicly cryptography I would say is"
"11-30","20:53","very very important um for security"
"11-30","20:58","so basically in public key cryptography the sender and the receiver they do not"
"11-30","21:05","share the secret key this this approach is very different"
"11-30","21:11","from the symmetric key encryption the public key"
"11-30","21:16","okay the public key is known to everybody to or"
"11-30","21:22","but the private key is known only to the receiver"
"11-30","21:27","so in public key encryption and decryption or public key"
"11-30","21:33","crypto cryptography we usually have both"
"11-30","21:44","we have a pair keep here public key and also private key okay again public key"
"11-30","21:49","is public private key is private okay so known only to the receiver"
"11-30","21:57","okay so then how is this used let's see this example in this example again we"
"11-30","22:04","have Alice and Bob now if Alice wants to send a message to Bob"
"11-30","22:13","and it will first link encrypt the data for the message"
"11-30","22:20","with Bob's public key we know public key is public to everyone right"
"11-30","22:28","so of course L is no Bob's public key so Alice will encrypt the message with with"
"11-30","22:34","Bob's public key and then when Bob received this message"
"11-30","22:42","receive this Cipher text Bob will do the decryption using his own"
"11-30","22:48","private key it's very interesting okay so firstly Alice will do encryption with"
"11-30","22:54","Bob's public key and then Bob will equip with his own private key"
"11-30","23:02","okay so actually this has changed significantly"
"11-30","23:08","the we of cryptography the 2000 year old"
"11-30","23:13","or we know as symmetric K cryptography"
"11-30","23:19","okay and actually this idea of public key very interestingly"
"11-30","23:24","um this idea is was developed in U.S and"
"11-30","23:29","UK independently roughly at the same time okay the same idea"
"11-30","23:36","so then now let's look at the encryption algorithm the requirement"
"11-30","23:42","for this public inclusion algorithm is that firstly we need"
"11-30","23:51","the public key we use KB plus to wrap in the public key"
"11-30","23:57","and the KB minus to represent the private key okay so"
"11-30","24:04","then we know given a message if we encrypt it with public key"
"11-30","24:12","we can then decrypt this ciphertext with the predicate to get this message"
"11-30","24:20","from M again this is the first requirement the second requirement is"
"11-30","24:26","given public key KB Plus it should be impossible to compute the"
"11-30","24:35","private key B minus why because we know public K is publicly"
"11-30","24:44","available so everybody can see the public key then if"
"11-30","24:49","it is possible to compute the private key then this entire"
"11-30","24:56","public key encryption map method will fail right so that's why we should make sure"
"11-30","25:04","it's not possible to compute the private key through the public key okay so those"
"11-30","25:11","are the two requirements keep academic in mind one very commonly used public key"
"11-30","25:19","inclusion algorithm is called RSA RCV is very very common and it's foundational"
"11-30","25:26","okay so let's look at the IC album"
"11-30","25:33","um I I'll give I I know this is probably a bit abstract to you but I'll give you"
"11-30","25:38","an example and hopefully you can understand the general idea why I say"
"11-30","25:44","um for the foundation for the theory behind"
"11-30","25:50","RSA we will not talk about that in detail like the numbers here Theory"
"11-30","25:55","right so we will we will just ignore that part but I still want you to have an idea how this algorithm is uh used"
"11-30","26:04","okay so firstly we pick two large Primes p and Q"
"11-30","26:13","so for example let's pick p as 3 and Q as 11. these two"
"11-30","26:20","numbers are very small so 311 are very small but in reality in real RSA p and Q"
"11-30","26:27","will be very large prime numbers they cannot be very small if they are very"
"11-30","26:32","small then this algorithm is not very secure okay"
"11-30","26:38","so you can easily guess the inclusion decryption K or the"
"11-30","26:44","private and public key okay so the next and let's calculate n"
"11-30","26:51","equals to P times Q it's very easy right and equal to 3"
"11-30","26:56","times 11 equals to 33. after that we pick e"
"11-30","27:04","such that it is relatively Prime to Phi n what is Phi n 5 is Q"
"11-30","27:14","minus 1 times P minus 1. so"
"11-30","27:21","that means 5 equals to 3 minus 1 is 2. 11 minus y is 10. so 2"
"11-30","27:31","times 10 equals to 20. we want to pick a e that is prime to 20."
"11-30","27:40","so we can pick a number for example here we can pick 7. there is some way to"
"11-30","27:46","calculate to to to help you pick this number e okay so 7 is relatively prime"
"11-30","27:53","to 10 because their greatest common"
"11-30","27:59","divider is one okay and then next we want to calculate"
"11-30","28:05","another number D d can make"
"11-30","28:12","d e mode Phi n equals to 1. okay again"
"11-30","28:17","there is some way to help you do the calculation and in this case we can say okay"
"11-30","28:25","D equals to third by some calculation we know D equals 3 because what because"
"11-30","28:32","through is d right okay 3 times e"
"11-30","28:40","is 7. okay mod"
"11-30","28:46","ER what modify n y n is 20."
"11-30","28:52","this equals to one right twenty twenty one two times"
"11-30","28:58","seven equals 21 21 mode 20 equal to 1. so that's why we choose D equal to 3."
"11-30","29:07","Okay so so that D times e multiply n can equal"
"11-30","29:14","to 1. again there is some algorithm how do you calculate D but now you remember that"
"11-30","29:20","okay after that we get the public key"
"11-30","29:26","public K is K plus which is e and n"
"11-30","29:32","okay it's a it's a a tube obviously okay e is a"
"11-30","29:39","foreign"
"11-30","29:44","and N is 33. so the probability K is then"
"11-30","29:50","DN D is a three we have calculated and N is third"
"11-30","29:57","season okay so now you can remember"
"11-30","30:04","for e okay you can even if you want to remember this you can remember it as"
"11-30","30:11","encryption and for D you can remember as as a decryption so that you know okay e"
"11-30","30:19","n is the public K and DN is the probability so now let's remember this"
"11-30","30:30","so public key remember is a 7 33"
"11-30","30:36",". and private key is 33."
"11-30","30:48","okay so we know 33 is n"
"11-30","30:53","and this is e this is D and this is a okay third is D"
"11-30","31:00","and it's a 33. now let's see how the data can be encrypted"
"11-30","31:09","and decrypted so basically this is how we get the"
"11-30","31:14","cipher text"
"11-30","31:30","okay firstly for the encryption process we have plain text this is the plain"
"11-30","31:36","text plain text to the power"
"11-30","31:42","of E which is 7 right in this example mod and"
"11-30","31:51","okay then we get the cipher text then when we do the decryption we use"
"11-30","31:56","the ciphertext to the power of d which is the"
"11-30","32:03","part of the private key mode n and then we get the plain text"
"11-30","32:08","okay so now let's look at example for example if we want to send a data"
"11-30","32:13","a piece of data which is four okay a very simple message before then"
"11-30","32:19","how can we generally design for text we use four"
"11-30","32:25","to the power of E which is 7."
"11-30","32:30","mod n n is 33. if you calculate a number this equal to"
"11-30","32:37","16 which means the plain text is a four and then the"
"11-30","32:44","ciphertext is a 16."
"11-30","32:52","okay and when we do the decryption we will use"
"11-30","32:58","16 the cipher text to the power of D which is a"
"11-30","33:05","3. mode and again this will equal to"
"11-30","33:12","4. as you can see 4 is what the plane"
"11-30","33:17","text this is like a magic right so you use the side the plain text"
"11-30","33:27","encrypt it with the public key e n"
"11-30","33:33","and you get server text later you take the ciphertext"
"11-30","33:40","then you do the same calculation using"
"11-30","33:45","the Prodigy then you can get the plain text right so it's like magic"
"11-30","33:54","and you may ask what if I do this in a different way"
"11-30","34:00","so now you can see in this case we are doing encryption with public key and"
"11-30","34:05","then doing decryption with private key what if we switch"
"11-30","34:10","that means we firstly do the encryption with private key and then do the"
"11-30","34:19","equation with the public key so again we know"
"11-30","34:26","K plus which is the public key"
"11-30","34:32","is 7 33"
"11-30","34:51","okay so still the same number 7 33 and for private key"
"11-30","34:59","is 3 33 okay so what if we still send the same data"
"11-30","35:08","okay but this time we want to encrypt with"
"11-30","35:15","private key first okay which means given 4 we want to"
"11-30","35:20","increase with probability which is uh 33. so 4 to the power of what D which is"
"11-30","35:29","third mod 33 this equals 31. so that"
"11-30","35:34","means the plain text is a four and the ciphero text is uh 31."
"11-30","35:41","and now we do decryption we have 33"
"11-30","35:46","sorry 31 ciphertext and we want to use the public key"
"11-30","35:52","through the decryption so that in the public key e is a"
"11-30","35:57","7. the mod and then we get a 4 again"
"11-30","36:04","this is very interesting right so that means even if you switch"
"11-30","36:10","the private key and public key switch the order the inclusion and equation"
"11-30","36:15","order they still have the same Effectiveness okay so that means that"
"11-30","36:22","means given the same message"
"11-30","36:27","if we do the encryption with public key first"
"11-30","36:33","and Then followed by private key"
"11-30","36:39","this will recover m it is the same as you're firstly doing"
"11-30","36:46","the encryption with provocate and then do the decryption with public"
"11-30","36:53","key you still recover m that means it doesn't really matter"
"11-30","36:58","which order you do okay the result is the same actually"
"11-30","37:04","this property is very very useful as you can see later when we discuss the detail"
"11-30","37:11","signatures of the conventionality things like that authentication itself you can"
"11-30","37:16","see this is obviously this is a very uh"
"11-30","37:21","very smart or very brilliant okay so uh this kind the public key cryptography is"
"11-30","37:29","one of the most important um design and development in the"
"11-30","37:35","security field okay now let's see how the RSA can be used"
"11-30","37:41","you think about this how can this be used so firstly given a message app"
"11-30","37:50","we can first use the recipient public key against the message which means we"
"11-30","37:57","encrypt the message with publicly and then later"
"11-30","38:02","the private key can be used to restore the original message"
"11-30","38:08","this is basically used for confidentiality okay for example if you"
"11-30","38:14","want to send a message to somebody you can use that person's public key and"
"11-30","38:20","then after that that person receives the cipher text then he or she can"
"11-30","38:25","decrease the message with his or her own privacy so this is a full"
"11-30","38:31","confessionality and a different type of use is that give her a message"
"11-30","38:38","we can firstly use the sender's private key to sign the"
"11-30","38:45","message to do the encryption okay and then later"
"11-30","38:51","when the receiver receives this the receiver can use the public key to"
"11-30","38:59","verify the signed message because it can the public can be used to recover the"
"11-30","39:04","message right and this private key is only known to the sender"
"11-30","39:11","nobody else knows the sender's private key so of course if later this"
"11-30","39:17","ciphertext can be decrypted by the sender's private key then we are"
"11-30","39:24","sure this message is sent by this person by the sender nobody else because nobody"
"11-30","39:31","else has the private key of the sender so that is used for digital signature"
"11-30","39:39","that is actually the idea of digital signature this is usually used for"
"11-30","39:44","different purposes like for example for Content Integrity content integrity means we can use this to prove"
"11-30","39:52","the message itself or the content itself is not changed okay and we can also use this for"
"11-30","39:58","authentication or Source Integrity which means oh this message is indeed sent by"
"11-30","40:07","this person not anybody else okay and this can also be used for noun"
"11-30","40:13","repudi reputation repetition which means"
"11-30","40:19","the sender once this sender sign with the private key"
"11-30","40:26","he or she cannot deny this because nobody else knows his or her priority"
"11-30","40:32","okay so this is a different use for RSA"
"11-30","40:38","you can see ISE can be used for different purposes all right now let's look at this example"
"11-30","40:46","so for this example this is a four computationality"
"11-30","40:56","okay so firstly you can see the sender has plain text"
"11-30","41:01","this plain text can be encrypted with the recipients public key"
"11-30","41:09","and then we generate the ciphertext after the recipient of the receiver"
"11-30","41:15","receives this such text it can decrypt the message with the recipient's private"
"11-30","41:24","key to recover the plain text so this is to protect the message"
"11-30","41:31","okay so this is the four conditionality then we can also use"
"11-30","41:37","RSA for detail signature and keep in mind the public key cryptography is usually"
"11-30","41:46","very expensive computationally intensive"
"11-30","41:51","so usually when we do the encryption using a public key"
"11-30","41:57","for example especially for long messages a super long message it can be very very"
"11-30","42:04","expensive if we are using crypto if you are using public key cryptography so"
"11-30","42:09","that's why usually if we have a long message we will first lay"
"11-30","42:16","generator digest for this long message how do we do that we use a hash right we"
"11-30","42:24","all learn the hashing algorithm before right so we use a hash to generate a digest of the message this hash is a"
"11-30","42:32","is very this digest is very short compared to the message"
"11-30","42:38","the read the message and then later we can use"
"11-30","42:43","and this is a private key to encrypt only the Digest"
"11-30","42:50","we do not need to increase the entire message we only need to increase Digest"
"11-30","42:56","and then generate the encrypted massive Digest"
"11-30","43:02","we send this entire thing to the receivable then what Bob will do is"
"11-30","43:09","Bob for the same message okay here we do not care about"
"11-30","43:15","computationality we are thinking about the Integrity so basically with this"
"11-30","43:22","message the same message Bob we are also run the same hashing algorithm to"
"11-30","43:30","generate the Digest"
"11-30","43:35","okay meanwhile meanwhile after receiving this encrypted"
"11-30","43:43","Digest Bob will use analysis public key"
"11-30","43:50","to decrypt the message and get the message digest so Bob will compare these"
"11-30","43:58","two and see if they are the same if they are the same then we can say"
"11-30","44:06","okay the message is transmitted correctly nobody else has already changed the"
"11-30","44:13","content and it is indeed sent by Alice but if they are not the same then we say"
"11-30","44:20","the message has already been modified so this is the general idea of a digital"
"11-30","44:27","signature based on RSA algorithm okay and later we are going to spend more"
"11-30","44:32","time discussing this so why is ISA secure"
"11-30","44:42","suppose you know Bob's public key n and E we know public key is known to"
"11-30","44:49","everybody okay then how hard is it to determine d"
"11-30","44:55","which means if you know the public key can you calculate and get the private key"
"11-30","45:03","so if you look at the algorithm here"
"11-30","45:13","okay if you look at the algorithm here we know"
"11-30","45:18","the public key e and we know the number n"
"11-30","45:24","okay if you are able to calculate p and Q by"
"11-30","45:31","n through n then based on this"
"11-30","45:38","you can easily calculate d"
"11-30","45:43","which is the priority okay because you already know p and Q"
"11-30","45:49","you already know e okay you know p and Q you know n you"
"11-30","45:55","know um you know e and of course you can guess D okay you can calculate d"
"11-30","46:02","however because N is a very big number"
"11-30","46:08","is a huge number it's very hard"
"11-30","46:13","to calculate the prime factors of n which are p and Q is very hard to"
"11-30","46:20","calculate p and Q this make it very hard to calculate the"
"11-30","46:27","number D which is the probability okay so that is actually why"
"11-30","46:35","RSA is q okay"
"11-30","46:40","because factoring a b prime number"
"11-30","46:51","is really hard okay if we cannot find out p and Q"
"11-30","46:57","then it's hard to find out D that's the main reason okay"
"11-30","47:04","um then in practice do we really use RSA"
"11-30","47:10","to encrypt the content of the message the answer is no"
"11-30","47:16","okay you think about this if Alice and Bob are communicating with each other they want to exchange the messages and"
"11-30","47:23","the messages may be very long right now in this case if we want to use"
"11-30","47:30","RSA to do the inclusion equation it's computationally intensive"
"11-30","47:37","very intensive okay um in contrast the symmetric key methods"
"11-30","47:46","are much more easier and faster than RSA much more"
"11-30","47:53","faster so for example DS is at least 100 times faster than Ric"
"11-30","48:00","that's why you relay we only use the public key cryptography"
"11-30","48:07","to establish the secure connection so that the Alice and above can exchange"
"11-30","48:14","a symmetric key which we also call it as session key"
"11-30","48:20","okay and then this session key can later be used to really do the inclusion and"
"11-30","48:27","equation of the message okay so that means"
"11-30","48:33","um for um the encryption and equation about the the message or the content for the"
"11-30","48:39","communication we can use session K which is a symmetric key method okay but how"
"11-30","48:47","can we exchange this session key we they cannot meet we assume they"
"11-30","48:54","cannot meet with each other physically right so then they can exchange a symmetric session key"
"11-30","49:01","with the RSA method okay so this is how RSA is used in"
"11-30","49:07","practice all right so that is"
"12-02","0:04","all right so that is all I want to talk about the principles of cryptography"
"12-02","0:11","then let's let's look at the Authentication let's see how authentication can be done"
"12-02","0:17","using the foundation of cryptography so authentication basically means Bob"
"12-02","0:26","wants edits to prove her identity to him so the protocol number one"
"12-02","0:34","is addicts can simply say hey I'm Alice"
"12-02","0:39","but can you trust Alice can you trust her do we have any finished scenarios of"
"12-02","0:46","course because Trudy can also see I man is how can you prove that right in real"
"12-02","0:52","world we can see the faces but in the cyber world in a network"
"12-02","0:59","Bob cannot really see Alice so Trudy can simply declare herself to be Alice okay"
"12-02","1:07","or even a dog a cat can declare to be Alice"
"12-02","1:15","so let's try again how about Ellie say hey I'm Alice"
"12-02","1:22","in IP packet and also attend her Source IP address"
"12-02","1:29","into this package then you may think oh that is better right because"
"12-02","1:36","Alice has already appended the IP address but if you recall what we have learned"
"12-02","1:43","in chapter one it's actually very easy to do spoofy IP spoofy Trudy can also"
"12-02","1:50","attach Alice's IP address and claim she's Alice"
"12-02","1:56","right so does protocol 2.0 work no it"
"12-02","2:01","doesn't work so then how about"
"12-02","2:08","Ellie says I am Alice and then also send her"
"12-02","2:15","secret password to prove it so this password is is a secret and we assume"
"12-02","2:22","truly does not know this password is this better"
"12-02","2:27","hmm let's think about this actually truly"
"12-02","2:34","can capture the message between Alice"
"12-02","2:39","and above how can Trudy do that if you think about the pack is sniffing"
"12-02","2:47","we learned about tech snipping before example you can do this using Wireshark"
"12-02","2:52","right then in this case Trudy can hear the communication between Alice and above"
"12-02","2:59","then Trudy can simply do a playback attack which means it's"
"12-02","3:08","captured the traffic between Alex and a bob and then same plane replay"
"12-02","3:16","and this is a message to Bob okay nothing is changed so still and his"
"12-02","3:21","IP address still and his password still seeing I'm at least okay then probably gonna say oh okay"
"12-02","3:28","this is Alice so this kind of attack we call it playback attack or we call it replay"
"12-02","3:33","attack so the same thing okay oh so it may you may think how about"
"12-02","3:41","we improve this a little bit instead of using just the password we"
"12-02","3:47","use encrypted password so the password is not in plain text is encrypted"
"12-02","3:53","does this solve the problem I'll say no why because still truly can simply"
"12-02","4:02","capture this package okay and then replay it"
"12-02","4:07","the same thing nothing can nothing is need to be changed nothing needs to be changed so"
"12-02","4:16","then Bob will still think two days at least okay"
"12-02","4:22","um then what can we do so in order to avoid this kind of"
"12-02","4:28","playback attack now we add some mechanism called nuts"
"12-02","4:35","Nas means a number that is used only once in a lifetime so this is a random"
"12-02","4:43","number okay so basically as we'll see I'm Alex"
"12-02","4:48","bubbly I say okay this is a nuts number are this is again this is once in a lifetime"
"12-02","4:57","it's a random number it it can be used for only for once okay"
"12-02","5:02","then the main reason is we want to approve Alice live"
"12-02","5:09","okay the Alice must return r encrypted with the shared secret key"
"12-02","5:17","okay and this is actually done"
"12-02","5:23","um using the share decay so this kit is known by both A and B"
"12-02","5:28","both L is in a ball now above no analysis line and only Alice knows the"
"12-02","5:35","key to increase the nuts so it must be Alice"
"12-02","5:40","is that correct we want to think about this again think about the scenario again"
"12-02","5:48","okay so in this case in this case because we are using nouns so of course"
"12-02","5:54","it's very hard for 2D to do replay attack because"
"12-02","6:00","we know this nouns is useful once right so of course Alice message usually will"
"12-02","6:06","arrive first if um true they want to replay this okay so to"
"12-02","6:14","develop send this same message again to Bob Bob will say okay I have already"
"12-02","6:19","received this right so this nouns can be used for only once in a lifetime so then"
"12-02","6:25","Bob will not uh take uh through this message as"
"12-02","6:32","Alice's message right because it will only accept the first copy"
"12-02","6:38","okay so but is this method 100 perfect"
"12-02","6:44","I would say no first name Alice and Bob still need to exchange the K so how can"
"12-02","6:50","they exchange the K is a problem one problem the second problem is since this"
"12-02","6:55","K is shared by Alice and Bob and later Bob can also claim to be Alice if Bob"
"12-02","7:02","becomes malicious right so Bob can also claim to be Alice and pretend to be"
"12-02","7:08","Alice okay so this is a second problem and another thing is sometimes the true"
"12-02","7:14","day can also collected samples to do some kind of crypto or statistic"
"12-02","7:22","analysis to get the K shared by these"
"12-02","7:28","two parties okay so those are the problems with this"
"12-02","7:33","um protocol 4.0 so to improve this again"
"12-02","7:39","we can use this uh public key methods"
"12-02","7:45","to do the Authentication so the way is like this"
"12-02","7:50","personality analysis and the Bob Wilson announced again"
"12-02","7:55","the Alice will include these nouns with its own private key"
"12-02","8:02","so then Bob will say hey please send me your public key"
"12-02","8:08","and then Alice will send the public key so later as you can imagine what Bob"
"12-02","8:14","will do will is Bob will decrypt this entire Cipher text with the public key"
"12-02","8:22","of A and generate r yeah and then because Bob knows only"
"12-02","8:29","Alice could have the private key so then"
"12-02","8:35","um the encrypted the r to actually be generated by this"
"12-02","8:43","okay but is it is perfect"
"12-02","8:48","no there is still a flow and actually a very obvious or very important flaw okay"
"12-02","8:55","because in this version we can still do man in the middle attack"
"12-02","9:01","or woman in the middle attack okay that means Trudy poses as Alice"
"12-02","9:09","to Bob the end as well to end so but that means This truly stands in the"
"12-02","9:16","middle between Alice and above and pretends to be Alice to Bob and also"
"12-02","9:22","pretend to be Bob to Alice how could the truly do this so firstly you can see"
"12-02","9:27","Ellie said I'm Alice and then Trudy will say I'm Alice"
"12-02","9:33","to Bob Bob Wilson announced are"
"12-02","9:39","so what it truly will do is truly will actually encrypt"
"12-02","9:45","are with its own privacy not Alice is probably actually"
"12-02","9:52","through this privacy and then Bobby Mercy send me your public key so to"
"12-02","9:58","reverse in the public key its own public key then after that Bob compute computes"
"12-02","10:05","by doing decryption the time the Cyber text with the public key of 2D and then"
"12-02","10:16","finally generate R and Bobby will think oh okay everything matches this is indeed the"
"12-02","10:23","nouns I sent to Alice so this must be Alice"
"12-02","10:28","at the same time okay truly can send the same r"
"12-02","10:36","to Annie's and is will increase"
"12-02","10:41","this r with its own provocate and two diversity send me a public key so truly"
"12-02","10:47","is basically pretending to be bought in this case then it will send the public key"
"12-02","10:57","and then after that of that Bob sends a personal message and"
"12-02","11:05","to Alice potentially this is a personal message M to only Alice"
"12-02","11:11","and then because Bob will think blah blah think"
"12-02","11:18","Trudy is Alice so Bob will use"
"12-02","11:24","through this public key to encrypt the message"
"12-02","11:31","okay it will not use analysis because Bob will think truly is Alice right then"
"12-02","11:37","Trudy can easily recover M because of course truly has its own private key"
"12-02","11:46","right then truly we are basically send this message"
"12-02","11:53","to Alice with Alice's public key"
"12-02","11:59","so then when Alice receives it Alice will decouple this thing with its"
"12-02","12:06","own private key okay so then and it feels like this"
"12-02","12:13","message is from Bob but it's actually from Trudy well we feel like it is"
"12-02","12:19","sending the message through Alice but it's actually sending to Trudy it's just"
"12-02","12:24","truly in the middle is doing the increasing and decoration okay"
"12-02","12:31","um so then you can see this entire thing"
"12-02","12:36","has a big problem then think about this why"
"12-02","12:42","where are the mystics right what are the mistakes"
"12-02","12:48","made here so if you think about this very"
"12-02","12:53","carefully you will you will find out the main reason is because"
"12-02","13:00","when Bob is authenticating Trudy or authenticating Alice"
"12-02","13:07","it said send me your public key right"
"12-02","13:13","so it is asking for the public key"
"12-02","13:19","from whoever is sending the message so of course if today is including with"
"12-02","13:28","its own private key and it can send its own public key"
"12-02","13:34","if we really really want to authenticate Alice here what we actually we need to"
"12-02","13:39","use is Alice's public key not through this publicly right so that's the main"
"12-02","13:46","reason why we have a flow here that means the public key"
"12-02","13:55","should be absolutely correct if you ask the public key from only the"
"12-02","14:01","sender that will cause the center consenting anything how can you do the verification you cannot right so you"
"12-02","14:08","have to verify this by getting a absolute correct public key"
"12-02","14:15","right so that's the main reason but how can we do that how can we do that we can get the"
"12-02","14:23","absolutely correct public key from somewhere okay from say a later without"
"12-02","14:31","we will learn about this okay but we before we talk more about that I want to"
"12-02","14:37","talk a little bit about the message integrity and I want to introduce the"
"12-02","14:43","detail signatures first okay of course we we already talked about digital signatures but I I want to talk a little"
"12-02","14:51","bit more about that so basically"
"12-02","14:59","um digital signature is like the handwritten signature okay so the center Bob digitally signs a"
"12-02","15:07","document to prove that he is the document owner or creator"
"12-02","15:14","um and the recipient Alice can prove to someone that Bob"
"12-02","15:22","and nowhere else Including Alice must have signed document"
"12-02","15:28","okay so basically"
"12-02","15:34","um what we can do is Bob can sign this message m"
"12-02","15:40","by encrypting with its own privacy provocate to create"
"12-02","15:48","the sign message kbm okay so you can see this is a long"
"12-02","15:56","message we encrypt this with Bob's privacy to"
"12-02","16:02","generate this entire thing okay message together with the sign message"
"12-02","16:11","okay suppose Alice receives the message m"
"12-02","16:16","with the signature together with the signature then Alice can simply verify this"
"12-02","16:23","by applying Bob's public key to"
"12-02","16:29","the signature okay so then we can do kbm"
"12-02","16:34","decrease by Bob's public key and then we can recover"
"12-02","16:40","app okay so if we can indeed get m then this message must be signed"
"12-02","16:49","by Bob using Bob's property why we can"
"12-02","16:54","prove that why because only Bob knows its own product nobody else knows Bob's"
"12-02","17:01","property right so basically an incident can verify that"
"12-02","17:06","Bob sine M no one else sign m and Bob signed the message m not"
"12-02","17:14","anything else because we can recover m right and also this is a non-reputation this"
"12-02","17:22","may have non-repidation feature here because if there are some disputes between Alice"
"12-02","17:29","and Bob and it can simply take M and also the signature"
"12-02","17:36","of Bob to the course to prove that Bob have signed them so Bob has no way to"
"12-02","17:43","deny this because again only Bob knows Bob's private key"
"12-02","17:48","okay and as we mentioned before usually"
"12-02","17:54","it is very computationally expensive to use the public key English method"
"12-02","18:03","to encrypt the long messages that's why usually if we have a large"
"12-02","18:09","message we will firstly run as hash function to generate a"
"12-02","18:15","digest or amp which is hm okay we call this a Digest"
"12-02","18:22","yeah and then after we have this digest we can sign"
"12-02","18:30","this digest instead of saying the long message okay this is a much easier way to"
"12-02","18:39","create a detailed signature so this is the entire process you can"
"12-02","18:44","see Bob since a large message firstly we generate hm"
"12-02","18:51","hash of the message by using hash function and then we can do the increasing by"
"12-02","19:00","using both private key to sign this digest to generate kbhm"
"12-02","19:07","this is the encrypted Digest okay then we send this entirety into"
"12-02","19:15","Alice when Alice receives it and it's mailed to two things"
"12-02","19:21","so firstly Alice will um use"
"12-02","19:29","let's see if you receive this right and it will use Bob's public key"
"12-02","19:35","to decrypt this message and of course we know it will get the HM right"
"12-02","19:42","decryption it will get HM and also at"
"12-02","19:47","the same time Alice will generate the HM which is the hash of the"
"12-02","19:55","message using the same hash function so as we'll compare these two and see if"
"12-02","20:02","that's same if they are the same then Alice can verify"
"12-02","20:08","this message m is signed by a bob"
"12-02","20:13","and the m is not changed but if they are different then that means that either the message"
"12-02","20:21","has been changed okay that's the that's the entire process"
"12-02","20:29","for the hash function there are a number of hash functions to choose from"
"12-02","20:36","so for example md5 is widely used md5 basically"
"12-02","20:41","compute uh 128-bit message digest in a four-step process"
"12-02","20:49","and pay attention the hash function we know it is one way"
"12-02","20:55","right one way means giving the input we can generate the Digest"
"12-02","21:01","but giving the digest it's very very very difficult to"
"12-02","21:06","get the input okay so that means if we are giving up"
"12-02","21:12","to 128 bit string X which is the hash okay it is really difficult to construct"
"12-02","21:20","the message M whose hash is equal to X"
"12-02","21:26","okay so that's why we call it one way um and Charlotte is also used okay so it"
"12-02","21:34","can create a 160 bit message Digest"
"12-02","21:40","so now let's go back to the problem we mentioned before again in the protocol 5.0"
"12-02","21:48","to remember this problem the my in the middle attack or um"
"12-02","21:54","okay so basically 2D is trying"
"12-02","22:00","to pretend to be Alice to Bob and also pretending to be Bob to X right and we"
"12-02","22:09","said the main reason is because we are getting the public key directly"
"12-02","22:14","from Trudy right of course 2 DB of Sunday's own public key"
"12-02","22:21","so how can we address this problem we say the public key should be"
"12-02","22:27","absolutely correct which means this public key should not be provided by today"
"12-02","22:35","it should be provided by ants or this public key must be at its public"
"12-02","22:40","publicly not through disability right then"
"12-02","22:45","that's why we actually need some authorities to manage"
"12-02","22:54","the public key okay or to certify the public keys"
"12-02","23:00","to ensure the public keys are indeed correct ones"
"12-02","23:05","okay so then we have something called certification Authority which is also"
"12-02","23:12","called C what is the email do is CA we are basically bind the public key"
"12-02","23:21","to a particular entity e okay so that means"
"12-02","23:27","this entity no matter is a personal website a router or whatever this entity"
"12-02","23:34","needs to register its public key with the certification Authority"
"12-02","23:41","and also provide the proof of identity if this is personal you may need to take"
"12-02","23:47","a driver license for example okay then the ca creates the certificate"
"12-02","23:54","binding the identity e to ease public key okay"
"12-02","23:59","so basically for example if we have Bob will take its own"
"12-02","24:06","driver license let's see as the identification or the proof of identity"
"12-02","24:11","two CA to register is on public key okay"
"12-02","24:18","so what CA mail do is see a real sign"
"12-02","24:25","this public key with its own privacy"
"12-02","24:30","what does this mean this means CE will say okay"
"12-02","24:38","let me prove this public key is indeed from Bob because I have verified this okay so c e"
"12-02","24:47","will sign it with its own private key okay and then generating a certificate"
"12-02","24:56","for Bob's public key and then so in the"
"12-02","25:02","future Bob can provide this certificate to anybody who is communicating with him"
"12-02","25:09","okay so say Hey you can see this is my public key and this is already signed by"
"12-02","25:15","the ca so is is of course correct okay so it's like here Trudy when"
"12-02","25:24","through the product is public key Trudy cannot provide"
"12-02","25:31","a public with certificate because he does she she does not have analysis"
"12-02","25:37","certificate right so it's like that"
"12-02","25:42","um then when n is one spot public key"
"12-02","25:49","Alice will basically get this thing this certificate first we know this"
"12-02","25:55","certificate is already it contains both public key and also it is signed by the"
"12-02","26:02","C is probably k so then later"
"12-02","26:07","Alice can decrypt this with cs public key to guess"
"12-02","26:13","Bob's routine Bob's public key okay so this is the entire process then of"
"12-02","26:19","course we can see this public key is absolutely correct okay it's not fake"
"12-02","26:25","because this is already signed by the C okay all right so that is about the"
"12-02","26:32","authentication and message integrity so the next thing I would like to talk"
"12-02","26:39","about is securing email so"
"12-02","26:45","for email communication it's still the same thing we still need to consider"
"12-02","26:50","conventionality integrity and availability okay"
"12-02","26:56","so now let's firstly talk about the confidentiality let's see Alice wants to"
"12-02","27:01","send a combination email to bot so if we are using"
"12-02","27:08","the um public key cryptography then we know it is very"
"12-02","27:16","expensive we have mentioned this again again right it's very very expensive"
"12-02","27:22","then what we usually do is okay let's use a random symmetric key let's use"
"12-02","27:30","symmetrical encryption method for the content equation okay that's why and it"
"12-02","27:37","will firstly generate a random symmetric private key KS okay"
"12-02","27:43","but how can we exchange this chaos how can we exchange this with Bob"
"12-02","27:49","we can use the public key cryptography right"
"12-02","27:54","so you can say Alice will then encrypt them email message with KS"
"12-02","28:03","meet the symmetric key for efficiency and also encrypt"
"12-02","28:08","this K itself with Bob's public key"
"12-02","28:14","so this is used to exchange the K right the symmetric key and then n is we'll"
"12-02","28:20","send both the encrypted message"
"12-02","28:26","and also the increment k"
"12-02","28:31","to Bob okay so this one is for the message"
"12-02","28:38","and this one is for exchanging the symmetric key"
"12-02","28:43","so this is similar to what we have discussed before okay and when Bob received this message"
"12-02","28:51","Bob will use his private key first to decrypt and recover the ks the symmetric"
"12-02","28:58","key is like the session key right and then it will use this"
"12-02","29:04","symmetric key to decrypt the message okay to decrypt this KSM to recover that"
"12-02","29:10","so this is for confidentiality now the next thing we want to see is"
"12-02","29:16","about the message integrity and Authentication"
"12-02","29:21","so we want to ensure this message is sent by Alice not anybody else and we"
"12-02","29:28","also want to ensure the message is uh not changed by anybody else right"
"12-02","29:34","so what Alice will do is still because this message is uh"
"12-02","29:42","probably a long message right so usually we do not directly increase this with"
"12-02","29:48","the public key cryptography so what we can do first is"
"12-02","29:54","we can generate a hash or the message"
"12-02","30:00","okay and then we sign this hash with Alice's private key"
"12-02","30:09","okay so then in this case later"
"12-02","30:14","Alice will send both of the message in clear text"
"12-02","30:20","okay and also the digital signature tube up here pay attention here we are"
"12-02","30:27","only talking about integrity and authentication we do not really care about confidentiality"
"12-02","30:34","okay and then and sends the message to Bob"
"12-02","30:43","okay so when Bob receives this remember Bob will do two things"
"12-02","30:50","first thing with a message m it's real"
"12-02","30:56","calculate the hash and generate hm and then"
"12-02","31:01","with this signed hash"
"12-02","31:07","okay it will decrease with A's public key and John M also hm also so Bob will"
"12-02","31:15","compare these two and save that same if they are the same"
"12-02","31:20","then we say no problem okay if they are not the same the N is will say oh Bob we"
"12-02","31:26","must say okay this message uh has already been chained by somebody else it had that oh it has arrows at"
"12-02","31:33","least right so that's how we ensure the message integrity and Authentication"
"12-02","31:40","so but what if we want to ensure all of that"
"12-02","31:46","we want to ensure confidentiality Mass integrity and also authentication right"
"12-02","31:53","so in the first two cases in the first case we consider only conventionality in"
"12-02","31:59","the second case we only consider message integrity and authentication in the third case we want to consider all of"
"12-02","32:05","them okay then how can we do this okay so it's uh actually it's the answer"
"12-02","32:13","is verse three four we simply combine them okay that means when they send"
"12-02","32:22","this uh uh message you can see okay we send three parts first thing we have each m"
"12-02","32:30","okay uh the hash and we include with is private key"
"12-02","32:36","okay we will of course send this to Bob"
"12-02","32:42","um okay and then also we will use this"
"12-02","32:48","message okay uh and then we will encrypt"
"12-02","32:56","this message with the symmetric key okay and we also need to exchange"
"12-02","33:05","the symmetric key so that's why we use bobs"
"12-02","33:11","public key to encrypt the case so we send all this through to Bob okay and"
"12-02","33:18","then Bob will do the decryption um to get this symmetric key and then do"
"12-02","33:25","the diffusion together message M then calculate the hash om"
"12-02","33:30","to compare everything okay and also uh um our course decrypt this entire thing"
"12-02","33:38","with um Alice's public key and then finally"
"12-02","33:43","compare that nhm with the hash wage web"
"12-05","0:03","okay so far we have discussed the fundamentals of security especially the principles for"
"12-05","0:11","cryptography and how cryptography can be used for authentication for integrity"
"12-05","0:18","for computationality ETC we have source examples in the email okay so we so for"
"12-05","0:26","example we know for computationality we need to firstly exchange the K right we"
"12-05","0:33","need to encrypt the k uh exchange encrypt the message with with the K and then we also need to"
"12-05","0:40","exchange the K with public K cryptography and for authentication and"
"12-05","0:48","message Integrity we also need to um uh calculate the hash of the message and"
"12-05","0:55","then encrypt this hash with the sender's"
"12-05","1:01","private key right so those are all those are the applications and we know how we"
"12-05","1:07","can use the cryptography in a proper way to"
"12-05","1:15","achieve the goal of confidentiality integrity and authentication so then for"
"12-05","1:22","the remaining sections in this chapter we will continue introducing how the"
"12-05","1:29","fundamentals can be applied to different layers of"
"12-05","1:36","networking okay and how the security is deployed in networking so the first"
"12-05","1:41","example let's say is the TLs so TRS is called transport layer"
"12-05","1:48","security although it is called transport layer security but is actually a"
"12-05","1:54","security protocol that is widely deployed above the transport layer it is"
"12-05","2:00","actually deployed in application layer and later we are going to see this okay"
"12-05","2:05","um tis probably you are not very familiar with this but if you check your"
"12-05","2:11","web browser especially if you are visiting some let's see Banks okay then"
"12-05","2:18","for example type in chase.com okay and then you will see"
"12-05","2:24","um beside the URL you will see a small icon of lock so that lock icon actually"
"12-05","2:31","indicates this is using the TLs okay so TRS is widely supported by almost all"
"12-05","2:39","browsers um and then the communication with the web"
"12-05","2:45","server is actually using the protocol of https okay the port number and the web"
"12-05","2:52","server side is support 443 it's not a port 80 anymore Port 80"
"12-05","2:59","is just for regular HTTP but if you are using https then the port number is"
"12-05","3:05","going to be Port 443 okay um so TRS is able to provide"
"12-05","3:12","confidentiality integrity and Authentication how is this done"
"12-05","3:19","competition entity is done through symmetric encryption Integrity is"
"12-05","3:25","achieved through cryptographic hashing and authentication is down"
"12-05","3:31","through public key cryptography okay so actually the early version of tis is"
"12-05","3:39","called secure circuit layer and we we have discussed this before right and TRS is"
"12-05","3:46","the newest version okay so generally TS provides an API that any"
"12-05","3:55","application can use so you can look at this figure this shows the HTTP view of TRS"
"12-05","4:03","so for example let's see originally we are very familiar with this"
"12-05","4:09","the application layer we use HTTP transportally reviews TCP and networking applicants IP right so we are already"
"12-05","4:17","very familiar with this protocol stack if we want to deploy TLS as we mentioned"
"12-05","4:25","many times before you cannot deploy TRS in transport layer"
"12-05","4:31","so we have to we have to deploy this at application layer okay there is a"
"12-05","4:37","description the application layer and transport layer so you can see that's why chaos is here and this is using TCP"
"12-05","4:46","if we are using UDP then you leave it deploy quic which also incorporates TLS"
"12-05","4:54","okay between the application layer and transport layer"
"12-05","4:59","so generally for TLS it provides a sign"
"12-05","5:04","for switch which means it provides a number of algorithms that can be used"
"12-05","5:11","for different purposes such as K generation encryption Mac and digital"
"12-05","5:17","signature here Mac is the math message authentication code is not the MAC"
"12-05","5:23","address okay pay attention to that and uh tips as 1.3 it's actually"
"12-05","5:32","um replacing the TRS 1.2 okay and these are the features of TLS it has a it is a"
"12-05","5:40","more strict I would say than the TLC 1.2 for example it requires the DH for"
"12-05","5:48","exchange okay rather than using either DH or RSA"
"12-05","5:55","so so in this case th is required okay this is not optional so things like that"
"12-05","6:01","so you can see these are the some of the features um if you look at the TLs 1.3 so it's a"
"12-05","6:10","very straightforward generally the client will say hello first basically in"
"12-05","6:16","the Hello message the client will tell the server which Cipher switch"
"12-05","6:24","are supported by the client and it will also indicate the K"
"12-05","6:32","government protocol the parameters Etc okay"
"12-05","6:38","it guesses those uh information and then the server will reply with another Hello"
"12-05","6:45","message the server will provide the selected design for Suite say hey the"
"12-05","6:51","client says I have this this um algorithm are available but this"
"12-05","6:57","protocol supported okay and then TRS the server will just reply say Hey Okay I"
"12-05","7:04","want to choose this Cipro Suite to for the further communication is like that"
"12-05","7:09","and most importantly most importantly the server will also provide a server"
"12-05","7:17","signed certificate we have learned that the certificate will contain the public key of the"
"12-05","7:26","server okay to prove okay this is indeed from this server this is for authentication"
"12-05","7:33","purpose right we learned this before okay and in addition to that the server will also provide the"
"12-05","7:40","parameters the key agreements protocol those kind of things So eventually the client will check the"
"12-05","7:48","certificate of the server to prove this is indeed from the correct server okay"
"12-05","7:55","the server is not fake and it will generate the K and then finally it can"
"12-05","8:00","now make application requests like https get message for example so this is the"
"12-05","8:05","handshake process okay so that is one example PLS"
"12-05","8:12","we know it is between application layer and the transport layer"
"12-05","8:18","so the next example is ipsec ipsec is actually a protocol in the network layer"
"12-05","8:25","let's take a look at this so you may think what is ipsec used for"
"12-05","8:32","so ipsec is used for VPN you may have already heard about APN before you may"
"12-05","8:38","have already used the VPN before right I I guess many of you have used VPN"
"12-05","8:44","especially during pandemic so VPN means virtual program Network it provides"
"12-05","8:51","provides like a tunnel between your computer and let's say if you are"
"12-05","8:59","connecting to the camps Network it provides a tunnel between your computer and the"
"12-05","9:05","um uh campus Network so it's like you are connected to the campus Network directly"
"12-05","9:12","in a very securing so that's why we call it why uh virtual private Network so"
"12-05","9:18","then the protocol uh behind is actually ipsec okay so ip72"
"12-05","9:26","certified four requirements the first one is confidentiality"
"12-05","9:32","which means we want to hide the contents of the package the second requirement is"
"12-05","9:39","the content authentication we have learned this before right content authentication means Integrity is the"
"12-05","9:46","package change replaced or fact we want to make sure it is not change replaced"
"12-05","9:51","or fake the third requirement of a VPN is arranging authentication which means we"
"12-05","10:00","also call it Source authentication right so which means is the sender"
"12-05","10:06","is the real sender lying about its identity is this really from the sender"
"12-05","10:13","right so this is also important the last requirement is NT replay we know replay"
"12-05","10:20","attack can be very easy right so the bad guy can replay a package sent by the"
"12-05","10:27","others we want to make sure this will not happen to the communication between the center and the receiver okay so"
"12-05","10:35","those are the four requirements we want to satisfy for VPN and then this is the"
"12-05","10:41","guideline for IP Circle okay so then how can we achieve"
"12-05","10:48","confidentiality no surprise encryption we have already talked about encryption right so uh we"
"12-05","10:56","have discussed multiple um encryption algorithms so in VPN"
"12-05","11:02","triple Des is used um and of course we all know that to do"
"12-05","11:08","encryption we need a key right but this K must be exchanged firstly between the"
"12-05","11:17","center and the receiver that's why we need some protocol called internet K"
"12-05","11:22","exchange protocol"
"12-05","11:32","okay so which is also called as Ike therefore Integrity the content"
"12-05","11:40","Integrity is given through the hash function we have learned about the different hash"
"12-05","11:48","functions right and the half function can also be K hash function which is"
"12-05","11:54","hmac so for example usually what we do is we directly do hash our data right"
"12-05","12:03","but in K the hash function um we can we can do something like this"
"12-05","12:10","so firstly k x or with data and then we"
"12-05","12:15","do hash then we do k x o with this entire thing and we do hash again so you"
"12-05","12:22","can see it is more complicated this is to prevent some potential"
"12-05","12:28","um leverage to the vulnerabilities or hash functions okay so you don't need to"
"12-05","12:33","know the details you don't need to remember this function you just need to know okay there is one type of function"
"12-05","12:41","hash function called hash function which can make it even"
"12-05","12:46","more secure and more complicated Okay so then we also need to know for the source"
"12-05","12:56","Integrity or the arranging Integrity so this is provided through the public key"
"12-05","13:02","and private key through the digital certificate okay we have learned about certificate we know"
"12-05","13:09","um certificates usually contains the public key right and public key of one"
"12-05","13:16","side the sender or the receiver and then this certificate is usually"
"12-05","13:22","um provided by some say right so of course"
"12-05","13:28","then the certificate can be or can be verified later"
"12-05","13:33","okay so it can also be provided by covers covers is another protocol which"
"12-05","13:40","provides the single sign-in so which means when you sign on one website on a"
"12-05","13:46","one one uh um once website then you don't need to"
"12-05","13:52","sign on the other related websites okay so um it's like that so for example for sex"
"12-05","14:00","state if we are using covers then you sign on for once only for canvas let's"
"12-05","14:06","say okay then you don't need to sign on for my DOT uh csu.edu anymore because"
"12-05","14:13","you you've already been authenticated okay so that is uh cobras"
"12-05","14:20","and then the last thing is about anti-replay and to replay we know if we"
"12-05","14:26","want to prevent this we must use something that is uh one time okay so"
"12-05","14:32","then that's why we can use one-time password or sequence number or timestamp"
"12-05","14:38","all of those things uh may work okay so then"
"12-05","14:44","for ipsec ipsec is the protocol for VPN"
"12-05","14:49","it's the full name is called Internet Protocol security it"
"12-05","14:55","um eventually this is essentially this is actually a framework of Open Standards"
"12-05","15:01","so it has three major components authentication header which requires ah"
"12-05","15:09","encapsulating security payloads which is called ESP and internet K exchange we"
"12-05","15:15","mentioned this before right ik so ah gives you the Integrity plus"
"12-05","15:21","Authentication and then the ESP gives you the"
"12-05","15:27","conditionality integrity and authentication ikey basically takes care"
"12-05","15:33","of the key exchange okay of course without case change we we cannot provide"
"12-05","15:38","the other functions so for these three components I will not"
"12-05","15:45","go to talk about the details I have to briefly give you an idea about those"
"12-05","15:51","okay so for ah for example here you can see we have run through one and router X"
"12-05","15:59","and voucher y then ah will basically do this at the router x side we we take the"
"12-05","16:07","IP header and take the data and then we add something called some"
"12-05","16:13","some K okay after that we calculate the hash of this entire thing okay and then"
"12-05","16:22","this becomes when you header a h so this data will this will be put into the age"
"12-05","16:27","field then at when the router receives the package the router will do the same"
"12-05","16:33","thing we it will also use IP header data indicate to uh calculate the hash of"
"12-05","16:40","this and then it will compare the received hash with the recomputed hash"
"12-05","16:48","if if this matches that means the data and"
"12-05","16:54","IP header are not changed okay it can also provide authentication because we"
"12-05","17:02","know this K this K is special okay this K is shared between the router X and Y"
"12-05","17:08","so we know this is from the wrong tracks okay"
"12-05","17:14","so this is ah um ESP is sp can be used in two modes"
"12-05","17:20","one mode is called transport mode it provides inclusion traffic between"
"12-05","17:25","two devices two peer devices another model is called tunnel mode which"
"12-05","17:32","provides encrypted traffic between two subnets okay so I won't talk about the"
"12-05","17:39","details for the equation authentication Etc but the major difference between"
"12-05","17:47","tunnel mode and the transport node mode is"
"12-05","17:53","for tunnel mode we know because this is between two subnets so usually the"
"12-05","17:59","tunnel mode has to generate a new IP header instead of using the IP header"
"12-05","18:05","directly it will generate the new IP header okay so this also protects the IP"
"12-05","18:10","address um the IP information"
"12-05","18:16","so then for transport node mode it will directly use the IP header okay so that"
"12-05","18:22","is the major difference for Ike ikey is the K exchange part okay"
"12-05","18:31","and uh pay attention usually between the two parties that for example"
"12-05","18:39","here router X and router y we need uh before we send the data we"
"12-05","18:46","need to firstly establish something called security Association from the sending entity to the receiving"
"12-05","18:54","entity okay so basically um"
"12-05","18:59","this security Association is like a session okay so it contains"
"12-05","19:07","some information very important information like"
"12-05","19:13","um for example firstly at identifier like SPI Security parameter index and"
"12-05","19:20","also the source address as a interface definition as interface"
"12-05","19:27","and the type of inclusion used in position K the type of Integrity Check"
"12-05","19:32","used and authentication key Etc you can see a lot of information are actually"
"12-05","19:38","contained in this security Association okay so we know although IP is"
"12-05","19:46","connection is but ipsec is connection oriented it's like before we do sending"
"12-05","19:52","data we firstly need to establish such a connection to"
"12-05","19:58","provide some information okay and this is an example you can see you"
"12-05","20:04","can see the SPI Source IP destination IP the protocol use the encryption"
"12-05","20:09","algorithm we use the etc etc okay so again I will skip the details and"
"12-05","20:16","this is about the Ikea so the last thing is about the firewalls"
"12-05","20:24","and IDs um these are very very common especially"
"12-05","20:30","in price Networks firewall basically isolates the organization's internal"
"12-05","20:39","Network from the larger internet"
"12-05","20:44","allowing some package to pass and blocking others okay so basically this firework can"
"12-05","20:52","protect the internal network from the internet okay we protect the trusted Goods guys"
"12-05","21:00","from the untrusted bad guys all right so"
"12-05","21:06","why do we need firewall firewall can actually be deployed to"
"12-05","21:12","prevent a diff a lot of different types of attacks for example it can prevent"
"12-05","21:18","the denial service attack we know the night or service attack means a lot of"
"12-05","21:24","traffic come to a server right the server cannot serve the legitimate users anymore so"
"12-05","21:32","then based on that we know okay we can how about we block some traffic if we"
"12-05","21:39","block some traffic then we are able to prevent the now service attack right for"
"12-05","21:47","example if we know okay a lot of bogus tcpr connections are from this certain"
"12-05","21:52","IP address or from certain IP address range then we can block all the traffic"
"12-05","21:57","coming from that IP address or from that IP address range Okay so"
"12-05","22:04","that's why we can use a firewall and so one example is the same flooding safe"
"12-05","22:12","bloody means the attacker try to establish many bogus TCP connections so"
"12-05","22:19","no resources are left for the real connections we know whenever we want to establish a TCP connection we need to"
"12-05","22:26","firstly send a c request right c equal to one if you still remember learning"
"12-05","22:31","basically means there are a lot of scene requests there are a lot of requests"
"12-05","22:37","trying to establish TCP connection that's why we have denial service attack then if we have firewall we can block"
"12-05","22:43","that okay um the second uh type is the file one can also prevent"
"12-05","22:52","illegal modification or access to internal data sometimes we or many times"
"12-05","22:58","we actually we don't want the public to have access to the internal data okay we"
"12-05","23:05","want to protect the internal data and the third type is is allow only to authorize access to"
"12-05","23:14","inside Network we know the inside networks may contain a lot of important"
"12-05","23:19","servers and workstations right so we want to protect the inside network from"
"12-05","23:26","the outside world that's why firewall is also very useful there are generally two three types of"
"12-05","23:34","firewalls stateless pecky filters State four Packy filters and application"
"12-05","23:42","get image let's discuss each of them so firstly for stateless package"
"12-05","23:47","filtering this is a very straightforward um basically the internal network is"
"12-05","23:54","connected to the internet why router firewall okay so the firewall can"
"12-05","24:00","be deployed on the router then this firewall may ask questions like"
"12-05","24:07","should the arriving packet be launching pack should the departing packet be let"
"12-05","24:13","out so things like that okay so then what we do is it's very easy we just check each"
"12-05","24:20","packet packet by packet and then make a decision"
"12-05","24:25","okay make a decision for each packet based on this information for example"
"12-05","24:31","what is the source IP address what is destination IP address what is the TCP or UDP um"
"12-05","24:38","uh Source or destination Point numbers so what is the message icmp message type"
"12-05","24:45","or what is the TCP simbit or TCP AC key bits okay so based on those information"
"12-05","24:52","for each package we make a decision should we allow it to pass by or not"
"12-05","24:59","okay so that is the status room so here you can see one example"
"12-05","25:05","in this example we check the datagrams in coming and outgoing Instagrams with"
"12-05","25:12","IP protocol field 17 this means 17 basically means this is UDP"
"12-05","25:18","okay if it is equal to 6 then this is TCP and we check this protocol field and we"
"12-05","25:26","also check the Source or destination port number okay if it equals to 23 that means this"
"12-05","25:35","is Talent connection okay so then we want to block"
"12-05","25:42","all those datagrams with IP protocol field equal"
"12-05","25:47","to 17 and with source of this number uh"
"12-05","25:52","that's that's an important number equal to 23. that means"
"12-05","25:57","we want to block all the incoming and outgoing UDP flows and TCP connections"
"12-05","26:05","okay so this is one example a second example is block the inbound TCP segment"
"12-05","26:13","with a c k equal to zero what does this mean if you recall what we have learned in"
"12-05","26:21","this tcp3 handshake we know there are three steps for three hatching right"
"12-05","26:27","so step one step one sing equals to zero sorry equal to 1 a c"
"12-05","26:36","k equal to zero this is step one you read the sender initiate this right then"
"12-05","26:43","the step two is the receiver the receiver will reply back so that for example if Step One is sent by the"
"12-05","26:50","client then step two is sent by the server the server will say okay C equals to 1 a c key equal to one basis"
"12-05","26:59","basically this is confirming right say yes we can talk and then the client"
"12-05","27:05","will confirm again okay so then same equal to"
"12-05","27:11","zero and a c k equal to one okay so this is the 3B handshake"
"12-05","27:19","if you look at example two block inbound TCP segments with a c k equal to zero so"
"12-05","27:25","among these you can see the first step has AC k equal to zero which means what"
"12-05","27:31","which means this this rule will prevent"
"12-05","27:37","the external clients from making TCP connection with the internal clients"
"12-05","27:44","okay the external machines cannot initiate tsp connection"
"12-05","27:50","with the internal machine but you may worry how about"
"12-05","27:58","the internal machine you want to make a connection to the outside if the internal machine starts this"
"12-05","28:05","first okay then the packet comes in will will become this S2 right"
"12-05","28:13","so basically AC k equal to one if x equal to 1 will allow it right it may"
"12-05","28:19","allow it so that's why uh this example 2 is one simple thing"
"12-05","28:27","okay one simple rule is actually preventing the external clients from"
"12-05","28:32","making this connection between with internal clients but allows the internal"
"12-05","28:37","clients to connect to the upside okay so I hope this clear"
"12-05","28:44","and there are some more examples here for example if the policy is no outside web access"
"12-05","28:54","then the file set the firewall setting will become drop all the outgoing"
"12-05","29:00","packets to any IP address with Point number eight"
"12-05","29:05","for any package that is going out"
"12-05","29:10","and with our destination 0.80 we will drop that"
"12-05","29:16","okay so that is the firewall setting so there are more examples I I will not"
"12-05","29:23","um talk about the details and you can look through them okay"
"12-05","29:29","so you may ask how can this be done how can this be implemented"
"12-05","29:34","uh this is a very straightforward the firewall policies are actually"
"12-05","29:41","implemented with Access Control lists okay it's like a table it's a table of"
"12-05","29:47","rules applied top to bottom to incoming packets okay"
"12-05","29:53","so for example you can say this is the action and this is the"
"12-05","29:59","condition okay so so for example for this the first line it says okay"
"12-05","30:06","for all the packets with the source address following uh falling into this"
"12-05","30:13","range and the destination address is outside of this range and the TCP"
"12-05","30:20","the protocol TCP and salt product is this that's important destination Port is 80."
"12-05","30:26","the flag beat is any for if if this packet"
"12-05","30:31","okay if this package certifies this condition then we allow this packet to"
"12-05","30:39","pass by so it's like that okay"
"12-05","30:44","and for this one it's similar similar so this is like"
"12-05","30:51","this is like if a packet is coming from outside this network to this"
"12-05","30:59","internal motion to the internal motion and if it comes from a web web browser sorry"
"12-05","31:07","web server okay and if this AC key bit equal to one then"
"12-05","31:13","we allow it so it's like that so you can see it is implemented with a number of"
"12-05","31:20","rules okay that is the stateless"
"12-05","31:26","package filtering but the status package version may have"
"12-05","31:32","a problem the problem is sometimes it may admit"
"12-05","31:37","the package that make no sense for example for this rule"
"12-05","31:43","for this rule you can see um the destination Port is 80. a source"
"12-05","31:50","Port is 80. sorry um and destination Port is this and AC"
"12-05","31:56","keep it equal to one so this this is like uh the"
"12-05","32:01","web server is replying to an internal machine"
"12-05","32:07","right the web browser web server is replying to an internal machine"
"12-05","32:14","this packet may not make any sense if"
"12-05","32:21","no TCP connection is established first right because we know the data exchange"
"12-05","32:27","had to happen after the TCP connection established okay but if no TCP"
"12-05","32:34","connection is established and we still allow such packets come in"
"12-05","32:39","it doesn't make any sense right so that's why"
"12-05","32:45","you're only we need to do some stateful Packy filtering okay which it which uh can"
"12-05","32:54","help track the status of every TCP connection and make sure we no longer"
"12-05","33:02","admit package that make no sense okay"
"12-05","33:07","so for example in this this is the example we just saw"
"12-05","33:12","right so in this example we will love the package"
"12-05","33:19","okay if there is already a TCP connection so that means we need to"
"12-05","33:26","check the connection for this type of packets okay even if they"
"12-05","33:32","have already fulfilled the other conditions but but we still need to check if there is a active connection"
"12-05","33:39","first okay so that is the state for packet theater"
"12-05","33:45","the third type of firewall is the application gateways uh the idea is very"
"12-05","33:52","simple so basically for application gateways it will filter the package"
"12-05","33:59","on application data as well as on IP TCP"
"12-05","34:04","UDP files Etc okay it does not only look at the like the source IP destination"
"12-05","34:10","IEP phone numbers Etc it will also check the application data that is very"
"12-05","34:16","important for example it may allow the select"
"12-05","34:21","internal users to download outside so only those"
"12-05","34:28","authorized users only these many users can tell net"
"12-05","34:33","outside and the other ones they cannot tell on the outside so this is like application layer okay so"
"12-05","34:41","um then in this way basically for the"
"12-05","34:47","for the authorized users the Gateway set up the Tanner connection to the"
"12-05","34:52","destination host okay and the Gateway is like proxy it will release the data"
"12-05","34:58","between the two connections okay uh then for the other talented"
"12-05","35:03","connections it will the ROMs will basically block all the other tenant connections"
"12-05","35:10","not originated from the Gateway okay so that is application layer application"
"12-05","35:17","ignorance and we know that is a firewall"
"12-05","35:24","okay firewall can do packet filtering but usually it operates on tcpl IP"
"12-05","35:32","headers only and it doesn't really correlate"
"12-05","35:37","um the different sessions okay so that's why uh it's usually for preventing"
"12-05","35:44","something from happening but more importantly sometimes we need to detect"
"12-05","35:50","intrusion we need to detect the attacks okay so that's why we need something"
"12-05","35:56","called IDs intrusion detection systems there are usually two types of ideas"
"12-05","36:08","so first type is called Signature based foreign"
"12-05","36:18","so the second type is called a normal detection signature based the base the mean basically means there are some"
"12-05","36:25","specific signatures within the package okay that can directly tell"
"12-05","36:32","ideas hey this packet is malicious okay so there are some signatures we can"
"12-05","36:39","directly check uh anomaly detection is different a"
"12-05","36:44","normal detection has no signature so basically what we do is we will check"
"12-05","36:50","the normal packets okay the usually this for example you leave this package are"
"12-05","36:57","normal and then we know the the outliers will be the will be abnormal right so"
"12-05","37:06","then we know if we see some outliers then we result alerts okay"
"12-05","37:13","so those are the two types the the um"
"12-05","37:18","drawback of anomalytes is it has too many false positives so sometimes it's"
"12-05","37:26","not a attack but we view it as an attack okay we view uh the packet as malicious"
"12-05","37:35","and then signature based also has some problems initial piece based will easily"
"12-05","37:40","Miss some of the malicious packets because sometimes we do not have any"
"12-05","37:46","signatures for malicious package right so those are the two types of ideas"
"12-05","37:54","um basically as you can see IDs can do deep packet inspection that means we do"
"12-05","38:02","not only look at the headers we also look at the content of the package okay"
"12-05","38:07","so for example you can check the character strains in the packets against the database of a normal virus or text"
"12-05","38:14","range that is a signature based okay"
"12-05","38:19","um and also the IDS is able to correlate"
"12-05","38:25","different packets okay multiple packets so it is able to look at a number of"
"12-05","38:33","packets say oh okay so they are related they may be used"
"12-05","38:39","as a series and they may be used um for attack okay because you can see a"
"12-05","38:47","series of packets or are connected in summary okay so it's like that"
"12-05","38:53","um we will we will not uh go into details about the ideas but as you can"
"12-05","39:00","see here the IDS is one type of security sensors that can be deployed in"
"12-05","39:08","um at different locations in the Enterprise Network in Enterprise now firstly you can see"
"12-05","39:14","this is the internet right and then we have firewall firewall which is able to"
"12-05","39:20","uh block the traffic okay to filter the traffic between the internet and the internal Network"
"12-05","39:28","so this part is called demilitarized"
"12-05","39:33","zone or we call it as DMZ okay in the DMZ we really have web"
"12-05","39:40","server DS server file server Etc we have"
"12-05","39:45","those servers there because usually these servers are open to the public okay they have to serve the clients"
"12-05","39:53","and um what will happen is actually after DMZ we have another firewall here"
"12-05","40:01","okay and this will separate the DMZ and the inside Network"
"12-05","40:11","so in the inside Network we may have more important computers or workstations there and then"
"12-05","40:19","the ideas I did the IDS sensors can be deployed at different locations like in"
"12-05","40:25","DMZ or the internal Network okay or even the inside Network or email some uh"
"12-05","40:32","servers sometimes okay or some workstations okay so this is based on"
"12-05","40:37","different purposes then we can make the decision whether to deploy the ideas"
"12-05","40:44","okay so that's all what I want to cover about the security part"
"12-05","40:49","I hope you can understand the three most important components of security CIA"
"12-05","40:56","computationality integrity and availability okay I hope you also"
"12-05","41:02","understand the basics of cryptography the symmetric and public key"
"12-05","41:07","cryptography and how this can be used for uh computationality for integrity"
"12-05","41:14","and for authentication okay then uh we all we also learned the security can be"
"12-05","41:21","used in different scenarios like a secure email TLS and ipse and we also learned some of"
"12-05","41:29","the security matters like the firewalls and IBS okay so I don't expect you to"
"12-05","41:36","know a lot of details about those because you will eventually learn these"
"12-05","41:41","things in CSC 154 the network security course"
"12-05","41:47","um for our course 138 you only need to know the basic concepts"
