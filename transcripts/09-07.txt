0:03
all right so the next thing I'm going to discuss is about a network uh structure
0:08
or we say internet structure okay so we mentioned at the very first I mean the
0:16
second class we've discussed or the third class act so when we do the discussion I asked what is network and
0:22
most of USA Network is a combination of nodes and links okay so basically we
0:29
know okay we have a number of devices and we need to connect them together but the question is
0:36
the question is how can we connect those devices together throughout the study we have we have
0:43
done so far you learned that it is not possible to connect every device to the
0:51
other device directly with one cable you imagine this this is this the scalability is is a really bad okay so
1:00
that's why that's why instead of connecting those devices directly with
1:06
cables okay we usually we need something called Network code the routers in
1:12
between right routers in return to connect those devices so basically we
1:18
have access Networks okay access now works means the
1:23
institutional Network the residential Network the mobile networks okay so
1:29
those devices will access Internet through the access networks so those
1:34
devices will need to be connected to the access networks first and then the
1:39
access networks are connected to the routers to the internet core okay
1:47
and we can see we can also support those access networks sometimes we also call them access isps okay so uh I shouldn't
1:56
say this I should say the access is access internet service providers SP or
2:03
internet service providers like Comcast atnt they are all internet service providers so those access isps basically
2:12
provide those access networks for you to connect okay
2:18
so that's why we also have residential ISP company ISP University ISP okay so
2:26
then the question becomes oh we have those excess isps how can we connect
2:31
them together okay because if you do not connect them together they are still isolated
2:38
it's still it cannot be called as Internet okay so then we need to connect
2:44
them together how can we connect them together let's look at an example
2:49
so the question is given millions of access isps how to connect them together
2:56
we can imagine how many access isps we have right so your home network can
3:02
become Access Network your company Network University Network they are all
3:07
access networks okay how can we connect them together can we do this
3:14
can we connect each ISP to every other access ISD
3:19
select this what do you think
3:27
how to set a weekend but not a good idea what do you think what do others think
3:34
is this a good idea connect each one probably didn't see this clearly let's see connect each one
3:41
with every other this can this we can do this right it's
3:48
like we connect it's similar actually to the question we discussed before regarding devices we can of course
3:55
connect each device with with every other device but it's not scalable
4:01
okay okay so you all agree that this is not a good idea
4:07
it's the same thing here in this in this question okay if we connect each access
4:12
ISP to every other it says IP ISP this
4:18
does not scale why if you think about this if we have n
4:29
if we have any networks or an access networks okay so then
4:35
when we connected the first one with every other one we need to make n minus
4:40
one connections right then for the second one
4:48
for the second one we need to connect to every other
4:53
Excel Network we need to make another uh minus two connections because it is
4:59
the second one is already connected to the first one okay so that's why it's a minus two
5:05
then the third one and minus three the fourth one
5:11
and minus four so we'll continue until we only need to make one connection so
5:17
this is the number of connections we need to make if you have learned how to
5:22
calculate this okay this basically equal to one plus
5:29
a minus one this one plus this one
5:37
time the number the number the total number is n minus 1 divided by two
5:44
so this is basically n times n minus one divided by two so you can see
5:54
okay so this is okay so that's why you can see the
6:01
complexity is actually o big N2
6:06
okay all big and square then this doesn't scale that's why this is not a good idea that's why we want to use
6:15
something in the middle to connect every Access Network okay so
6:20
now what is in the middle if what we put in the middle is called the ISP Global IST which can provide a
6:29
number of routers okay but can we have one Global ISP
6:36
apparently no why because
6:43
we may have competitors okay
6:48
you may have competitors
6:54
Jim said okay no problem James please go ahead to
7:01
reconnect and rejoin if you need okay sorry for interrupting
7:07
um so as we said we cannot have one Global SP we may have competitors then
7:13
the competitors here means we have a number of isps and we may have iSpa ispb
7:19
ispc okay or even more so it's like we have Comcast ATT so this is
7:29
this is within one country of course between the countries we may also have other competitors right so it's like in
7:36
China we also have other uh SP providers okay so then
7:43
now we have ice piece so you can see all the access networks are connected to ISP
7:48
to the isps but we still need to connect those isps together if they are not
7:54
connected together then again this internet is is not an internet right it's not connected
8:00
so then we will connect them using some peering links okay and on top of this okay we may have
8:08
some internet exchange points okay it's still used to connect those
8:14
um those isps okay the functionality is basically the same as the peer links okay
8:23
and then we may also have some Regional networks the regional networks can
8:29
connect those access networks and then be connected to the global isps or
8:34
connect to the to the isps okay on top of that we may also have some other
8:41
content provider Network so what are those uh basically some big companies
8:46
like Google you think about this like Google Microsoft especially for those
8:52
um video providers like YouTube right so they do not want to use
8:59
the services from the internet service providers why because they need to pay a
9:05
lot of money so some of those big companies they may run their own network
9:11
they may want to bring the services closer to the users okay so the users
9:18
can get faster speed you can access their resources faster like downloading videos faster like that so those those
9:26
Networks established by those big companies are called the content provider Network okay
9:33
later when we talk about the video applications we are going to discuss more about this
9:38
but now you can see you can see the structure okay the structure of Internet is basically a network of networks we
9:47
have a bunch of excess ice piece and then on top of that
9:52
we have Regional isps which may connect to the access isps and then we have some
9:58
Tier 1 isps and also the content provider networks so those all these things are connected
10:06
with each other okay they are interconnected so that's like the structure of the internet okay
10:13
any questions so far I XP
10:27
okay XP is internet exchange point so as we have
10:33
learned here do you see okay so basically sometimes we use uh
10:41
those those links called periodics to connect the ISP together but sometimes we use
10:46
internet exchange points to connect those ISP together
10:52
okay any other questions
11:00
okay all right so then you can see uh this is a like the theorem or one example for
11:08
tier one ISP this is the network for Sprint and uh you may say the those red points
11:16
are called point of presence so those point of presents are very important so
11:22
they have routers to connect to the backbone Network and they also have the
11:27
routers connected to the customers and then they need those routers be connected to each other okay so to make
11:35
this entire network work all right so that's all about the network core any questions so far
11:48
okay so the next thing we are going to discuss is about uh the performance of
11:54
the networks including the delays the loss the throughput Etc
11:59
we have learned about some of the delays like transmission delay before but today
12:05
we are going to cover more delays and we may have some calculations we may have some
12:12
questions that may appear in the test so please pay attention to this section the first question is
12:18
how do the delay and loss occur so I have just actually I explained in
12:25
the review just now right when the package arrives okay when the packet arrival rate
12:35
exceeds the output link capacity that means the incoming speed is faster
12:42
than the outgoing speed then in this case we may have
12:48
we may have the package queued here in the router so if the incoming speed
12:56
is much faster than outgoing speed then we may have the
13:01
package queued in the router this is called queuing delay okay
13:07
then those are those packets have to be queued there waiting to be processed by
13:12
the router if this if I mean the the speed are even
13:19
faster the incoming speeds are even faster and finally the router run out of buffer
13:28
then the router will say I do not have enough space to hold you okay so I have to drop
13:35
here that is called the package drop okay this is how the loss happens okay it's
13:44
like if in my office hours Let's see if I can handle if if let's say in the physical office
13:53
hours my office can handle at most common animals that 10 students in my
14:00
office then if we have the 11th one tells one coming I will say oh sorry I
14:06
cannot accommodate more students right now okay so please please leave then that's like package drop okay
14:14
so as I said this may become a test question I may
14:20
ask you how could the queen delay happen you
14:25
know that's because the incoming speed is bigger than outgoing speed okay if I
14:33
ask how could the loss happen then that's because the buffer of the routers
14:42
are for okay
14:48
okay um there is a question in the chat how is that corrected when a package is
14:53
dropped this is a great question if a packet is dropped what will happen
14:58
next what should we do okay this is actually one major topic we are going to
15:04
discuss in the transportator about reliable data transfer okay there are
15:10
actually a very complicated mechanism to correct that okay so for example we may
15:16
notify the sender say hey the packet is lost I didn't receive that please resend
15:22
it okay so the sender May resend it so that is one mechanism that may be used to correct this okay I don't want to
15:30
dive deep into this topic because we are going to keep devote a lot of time to that topic but hopefully hopefully that
15:37
gives you a basic idea to that problem great question question uh any other
15:43
questions
15:48
okay great so then let's look at the the
15:55
packaging delay packet delay is actually a very
16:00
important part in networking you think about uh if I'm not sure if you have
16:05
used any of the functionality functionalities before for example when you're playing a network
16:11
sometimes it will show how much time it takes for
16:17
uh for a packet to um to arrive at the destination and then
16:22
come back right or sometimes we say oh the network is very fast the network is very slow and what does this mean
16:28
Network fast basically means um your packets or your data can arrive
16:34
at the destination very fast okay then
16:40
um network is very slow means your packet can arrive at the network very slowly
16:46
okay then pack a delay is actually one major component in this
16:53
in this um in this process okay
16:59
so then what are the what are the reasons for packet delay why do we have
17:04
a pack really we have learned one reason one reason is called transmission delay
17:11
okay why do we have transmission delay if your skill remember what we learned
17:16
transmission delay basically happens because
17:22
we may have a link okay the link is like water pipe then the data is like water
17:28
you have to push the data into the link so that is the transmission delay okay
17:35
and in addition to that we may also have a third other type of delays one type is
17:43
called noodle processingly so what is nodal processingly no the processing link is usually used
17:50
by the routers to check the bit errors to determine
17:55
which output link I should forward this package to okay usually the noodle
18:01
processing delay is very fast it's typically smaller than 10 seconds okay
18:07
then that's another processionally it happens within the router okay that's the second type
18:14
we talk about one type transmission delay another type is noodle processing delay the third type of delay is secure
18:22
delay currently I have also mentioned right so q a happens because you need to
18:27
wait at the launcher okay for transmission
18:32
okay because there are so many packets written there it's like in my office hours again okay this depends on the
18:40
congestion level of the router the community Lane may be very long maybe very short okay so it varies
18:49
M second season is a milliseconds
18:54
okay yeah and then
19:01
um that's the third type of delay the last type of delay is called propagation delay what is professionally propagation
19:09
delay is the time we spent from one stop for for example after the package enters
19:16
the this and enters the link from one stop and here it arrives at another stop that
19:24
is the propagation delay okay so some of you may ask what is the
19:30
difference between transmission delay and propagation delay let's think about this
19:37
if um you are moving from Sacramento to New York okay
19:43
then the first thing you need to do is you need to pack all your stuff onto a trunk okay you need to push all your all
19:50
your things onto the truck that's like the transmission deal you are moving things onto a truck and then after that you have to drive
19:57
your truck from Sacramento to New York it may take maybe months
20:04
okay maybe days maybe months so that time is called the propagation DeLay So
20:09
you see the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay transmission delay is like when you pack your stuff onto the truck okay and there
20:17
is also another um now let's see here there is a Formula
20:22
here the formula here you can see the transmission the other propagation delay and this is how to calculate the
20:29
transmission delay transmission element have learned it's actually related to the packet length and the link bandwidth
20:37
okay so if we want to send 100 bits out and if we know the
20:45
link pandemic is uh 20 let's see 20 bits per second then the transmission delay
20:51
will be 100 over 20 that's fine okay so that's the transmission delay
20:56
the propagation delay is actually related to two things one thing is the
21:02
length of the physical link how long how long is this link the second is the
21:08
propagation speed of the single law okay the signal propagation speed in the
21:14
medium so then the propagation delay is very simple it's D over s
21:19
okay the distance over speed I think I believe you have learned this before right
21:26
I mean physics in Facebook you have probably learned this
21:32
so they are very different there is an example here a better example to explain the difference between transmission
21:38
delay and propagation delay for example now if we View
21:44
this Caravan this tank Caravan as one packet
21:54
okay this is one packet this card ticket has 10 bits okay we have 10 cards each
22:00
card is one bit then when they pass through when they pass through this table
22:06
then it's like we are pushing data into the link okay so we may take we may take for
22:14
example uh 12 seconds to push every uh to push every car okay
22:21
12 seconds to push every car then in total we have 10 cards then we have 120
22:29
seconds okay so this is like the transmission delay this is how this is
22:34
when you push the cars or this Caravan this team ain't throw the booth okay but
22:42
after that we have after that between these two both to the next toe box we
22:49
have such a long distance that's 100 kilometers okay then this card this car Caroline
22:55
has to draw uh maybe drive for two hours or three
23:01
hours to arrive at the second tour bus okay so that is the propagation delay
23:07
you see the difference okay so the time spent here
23:14
is a transmission delay
23:21
to push every character the time spent on the road
23:34
is called propagation delay okay
23:40
so now I want you to do a um maybe let's let me finish this let me
23:47
finish this and I'll do a give you a question you you can work on okay
23:52
so uh let's talk about the community a little bit okay the cunile is related to
23:59
third things one thing is linked bandwidth second thing is the Packy length and third thing is the average
24:06
package arrival rate okay you can say that this this traffic is
24:13
defined by the traffic intensity okay which is equal which equals to L A over
24:20
r okay and as you can see if we have more package arrival
24:26
okay if we have if this is a very large if a is very large Okay then if this
24:32
becomes bigger and bigger then the traffic intensity becomes higher and higher when it arrives at around one
24:39
when it approaches one then the Q delay is increasing
24:44
sharply okay it's it is uh close to Infinity that is uh that is the relationship
24:52
between current delay and the traffic intensity so it's like when you drive on
24:57
the road okay if there is no car you can see there's no car then of course we do not
25:02
have a lot of community but if there are a lot of occurs if there are lots of
25:08
cars then we may experience the queen delay okay
25:15
so when the traffic intensity is very very high then you have to be stuck on
25:20
the road for a long time okay so now let me give you a question to work on
25:45
so we have computer A and B and we have vouchers in between we have our package which has this is
25:51
the packet
26:06
okay we have l equals to 100 bits
26:12
R1 equals to
26:24
beats per second R1 equals to 20 actually equal to 10 and
26:30
R3 equals to 50 BPS okay these are the link capacity for
26:37
each link okay
26:56
so the current delay is 0.5 seconds at each router
27:09
thank you
27:29
another processing delay is one second at each router
27:34
foreign
27:51
A and B is 100 kilometer
27:56
okay the speed signal processing to be a signal propagation speed
28:03
equals to 25 kilometer per second
28:10
now I want you to calculate the total delay
28:16
equals to what so if you look at this
28:21
this is a formula here
28:26
this is wrong okay this is not total this is this is not uh know that this is total
28:32
the total delay equals to personal processing delay plus q a
28:38
please pay attention delay is the currently happened as all the routers
28:44
plus the transmission delay plus the propagation delay
28:51
okay so can you calculate this I will do this together with you but
28:58
hopefully when you review this video when you review this video please do the calculations on your own
29:05
okay because this may become a test question
29:11
we may have this in the exams okay so now we know the total delay equals to
29:19
four type of delays the transmission delay
29:24
Plus propagation delay Plus
29:30
current delay
29:35
plus the nodal processing delay
29:41
okay so then what is the total transmission delay
29:46
pay attention the transmission didn't happen at which places
29:52
at a we have to push it out as this router we have we have to push it out
29:58
okay at the second round should we have push it out again okay so then finally at the destination
30:05
do we need to put it out we do not okay we do not need to push it out at the
30:10
destination so then basically the transmission dealing happens at third places
30:16
a round Row one and round to two Okay so then that means
30:25
this is L over R1 that's the time we spend at a
30:32
plus l or R2 plus L over r 3. that's the
30:39
total transmission delay okay then what is the propagation delay
30:45
propagation delay is total distance
30:51
over the speed okay plus what is the queue
30:58
because 0.5 seconds at each router now how many
31:03
routers do we have we have two routers so we have that means two times D QE
31:15
okay plus no double percent delay again we have two routers
31:21
so at each round another percent delay is one second so that's why we have two times D nodal
31:30
okay then that means the next thing you do is just simple
31:35
calculation right so 100 over 20
31:40
0 over 10 plus 100 over 50. plus distance 100 over 25
31:49
Plus 2 times 0.5
31:56
okay this is
32:06
okay so then total you can see this is a 17
32:11
Plus 7 this is 24.
32:20
17 plus 7 that is uh 24 seconds so I hope you can you really understand
32:27
this exercise okay because we are going to have a similar test problem in the
32:33
midterm or even final okay and then you may know you may want to
32:39
know how the delay really look like in real internet right so here in the
32:45
example we said oh okay the delay from A to B is 24 seconds but usually we do not
32:50
have that laundry that kind of long delay okay you already delays are very short
32:57
um actually there is a program called trace route which can provide the delay
33:03
measurement from the source to every router along the way towards the
33:10
destination okay um so this if you run this uh
33:16
program you are able to basically find out uh the delay from The Source
33:23
computer a to the first router the second router
33:29
the third voucher Etc and then finally to the destination B
33:35
okay so here is a how it looks like let's see let's first say how it will
33:41
look like and then we come back to see um uh to see um how this how this program
33:48
is designed okay so if you for example if you if this is the source computer
33:55
this is a and this is the destination B okay so then you can run a trace a route
34:02
program from A to B okay then you can see for each line for each row
34:10
here okay this this IP address is the IP address for
34:17
the first router along the way okay do you remember between A and B we have R
34:22
by R2 R3 L4 okay so from a to R1
34:29
so so basically this is c s j w is basically uh Gateway
34:36
it's probably a one round chart between A and B okay it's probably actually it's probably the first router along the way
34:43
okay and then you can see we provide three delay measurements from a kaya CTU
34:51
to this R1 router okay and the third delay environments are respectively One
34:58
MS one milliseconds one milliseconds and two milliseconds okay it's like through
35:04
twice three matters okay so then this means generally the time we
35:10
spend or the delay between a to the first router is about to one to two
35:18
milliseconds okay then from a to the the second line is about the second router
35:24
so from a to the second router is also around one two two uh milliseconds okay so then
35:34
from a to the third router is the third line so to the third router is about
35:40
five to six milliseconds so you can see the time is increasing
35:47
the time is increasing from us a small number to a bigger number that's because
35:54
the distance is longer and longer okay and you can also see interestingly here
36:02
so here you can see at the row seven the seventh row you can say from a to this
36:09
router um the time spent is about 22
36:14
milliseconds but then from a to the router at Indus
36:20
eight line okay in the eighth row then you can see the time is
36:25
significantly increased okay the time spent from a to that router is about 100
36:32
uh and five uh milliseconds so the time increase
36:38
significantly from about 22 to more than 100 why because most likely most likely
36:46
so there is a Trans Ocean leak a trans Oceanic link between these two routers
36:52
so that this link is super long that's why the delay is increased uh
36:59
significantly okay so and then you can see this will continue continue until
37:07
eventually this uh we we reached we reached the destination computer
37:14
okay we reached the destination and then then you can see the time here is
37:21
basically this the one-way time we spend from A to B this is not a round trip not
37:27
a round trip time this is a one-way time uh
37:33
I'm not sure if this is round trip or one way actually let's see let's see what is designed here
37:40
uh provide another one from sauce
37:49
between transmission oh okay sorry this is actually a round trip time okay this
37:54
is a round trip time that means from A to B and then from B to a okay the B
38:00
sent a response back to a and then this is a actually the round trip time
38:06
okay any questions
38:11
yeah he's asking is this the package is this package of Aging or circuit switching this is a package switching we
38:18
are talking about uh the internet okay so the circuit switching is now really
38:24
rarely used actually internet so when we talk about internet we are you we are
38:30
mainly referred to the package meeting which means the routers okay the router and switches
38:35
any other questions okay so that's how the face route
38:42
program works and and that's how the internet delays look like in reality
38:49
okay and then now we want to come back to a look at this uh program how this
38:55
program is designed how could this program provide the
39:00
round trip time or the time interval between the transmission and reply okay
39:06
so what happens is actually very interesting so every time
39:11
every time the computer a will send out
39:16
three packets okay you can see what you you may ask why do we send out three packets because
39:23
we want to measure three times so as you can see for every router we
39:30
measure three times because we want to know because one time sometimes may not be accurate right so we want to measure
39:37
multiple times to say like the average to to make sure uh the time can indeed
39:44
reflect the delays Okay so again
39:50
again so each time the round the computer a send out three packets and
39:56
this third package will reach firstly for example the first time these
40:02
three packets will reach computer router R1 okay and the interestingly the third
40:08
pack is all how some failed
40:14
the field is time to leave
40:21
we also call it TTL okay TTL is a very commonly used term in networking okay so
40:29
time to leave is one field in the packet okay in each packet each
40:36
packet uh has they all have a TTL field and for the first time the tkl field
40:43
is set to one what does this mean this means hey the
40:52
first three packets your time to leave is only one hop
40:58
okay that means when there's a third package arrive at router R1
41:05
okay R1 will directly minus one on the
41:12
current TTL so that means TTL minus 1 equal to 1
41:20
minus 1 equal to zero okay and then this router will check the TL and we'll see
41:26
oh this is zero okay that means what that means hate I'm sorry you through
41:34
you cannot live anymore because your time to leave is just one hop and now your TTL is zero so you cannot go
41:42
further you have to be dropped here okay that's how how R1 will react then
41:49
but but even these three packets die okay the R1 will still be very
41:56
responsible around will notify the parents of these three packets okay notify basically notify computer Aid say
42:03
hey I'm sorry you're through Pakistan okay so later on you will learn this is
42:09
actually uh done using some protocol for the icmp and then email finally received the
42:17
notification from Aaron saying those three packets died okay and then a we are write down the time
42:26
of receiving the response so then it will calculate
42:32
the time between the transmission of these three packets and the response
42:38
from R1 okay or all the time when it receives
42:43
the response from R1 so then this time interval is called the round trip time so a will write down that time that's
42:50
why you can see actually here you can see for the third package okay
42:58
you have three time intervals to write down okay this these are all recorded by computer Aid and the second time so
43:06
second time a will try again okay a will try I'll try to send out
43:11
three packets again the second time the TTL is set to two
43:17
okay set to two two means these packets can travel two hops so when they arrive
43:25
at R1 foreign
43:36
on the current TTL so equal to 2 minus y equal to 1. then this means the
43:43
uh TTL is not zero that means these three packets can still go forward okay
43:48
so then when they arrive and then this third practice arrive at R2 R2 will do
44:00
the current TTL which is one okay minus one equal to zero there are two will say
44:08
I'm sorry you have to you have to uh stop here okay I have to drop you then
44:14
again R2 will notify a about the dropping of these three packets so it
44:20
will write down the time uh of receiving the response and the time of
44:25
transmission will cost then calculate the time interval will be turned down okay that's how the delay is between a
44:31
to R2 is uh calculated so basically these three numbers okay then you can
44:39
imagine they can continue the next time anybody has to send out the third package again with TTL equal
44:47
to Third and then when it arrives at R1 with minus one TTL minus one then dtl
44:54
becomes two so it continues to R2 then t r 2 will do TTL minus one again make it
45:01
TTL into one okay then it will finally reach our third and then after will do
45:07
TTL minus one equals to zero okay so then after we'll drop the third package
45:14
and notify Anya will record the time interval and then that is the time for
45:20
this okay so then we continue and eventually the third package will arrive
45:27
at the destination okay then uh the choice routes program
45:33
will stop okay that's how it works any questions
