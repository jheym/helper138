0:04
yeah so so it's a like like it's another
0:07
systems and the
0:09
the uh the layer stack and the protocol
0:13
stack is like two different uh Concepts
0:16
okay so we need to clarify that
0:19
okay all right so that let's look at one
0:24
example and then after this example you
0:27
probably can understand the
0:28
encapsulation much better okay in cap
0:31
solution and also how the internet works
0:33
okay much better you have a better idea
0:35
so as I said as I said as you can see
0:38
here we have a computer
0:41
a
0:43
computer B and switch S and a router are
0:50
okay then
0:53
as I mentioned as I mentioned in the
0:56
devices and systems we have all five
0:58
layers as you can see in a and b
1:01
they have application layer to physical
1:03
year
1:04
okay
1:05
then the writers only have three layers
1:09
physical layer link layer and network
1:11
layer switch has only two layers link
1:14
layer and physically okay so for now we
1:16
don't need to know why later in later
1:19
chapters we are going to explain more
1:21
okay but now I just want you to know
1:25
how can we send a message how could this
1:28
message be delivered okay how would this
1:31
work
1:32
so here
1:34
um there is one concept means
1:36
encapsulation and I'll explain uh more
1:39
about that okay so firstly if one day
1:43
you want to send a message this message
1:45
can be a email message can be a HTTP
1:48
request message for example if you want
1:50
to request for a web page whatever so
1:53
let's just assume this is a like like a
1:55
email okay email message then we have a
1:58
message app so this m pay attention this
2:02
m is at application layer okay you
2:06
basically you open your outlook you type
2:08
in a message then that's some okay
2:11
as I mentioned this message is usually
2:14
very big
2:15
okay your labor big of course it may be
2:18
super small but we have to uh usually we
2:21
have to break it into smaller pieces
2:23
okay after we break it into smaller
2:26
pieces
2:28
so here in this animation it doesn't
2:30
show that we break M into smaller pieces
2:34
but you should know you should know that
2:36
your lady we will do this kind of uh
2:38
breaking okay
2:41
and then this now the M comes down to
2:46
the transporter layer or a piece of M
2:48
comes down to transport layer okay
2:51
then transport layer is is like uh as we
2:54
said it will do the
2:56
um it will
2:58
um add some information okay it will add
3:01
some thing like transporter layer header
3:04
okay so header you can imagine this as
3:08
uh the envelope
3:10
okay so the message is like you you have
3:13
a several pages of a letter and now when
3:16
it comes to transporter layer we need to
3:18
add one layer of envelope okay on this
3:23
envelope we will write down some
3:25
information like
3:26
uh what is The Source process what the
3:29
destination process okay it's like uh I
3:33
need to write down oh this is from uh
3:35
showian sun to let's say to Michael
3:39
okay so it's like that so I need to
3:41
specify who is the sender who's the
3:44
receiver who is the signing process
3:46
who's the receiving process okay of
3:48
course there are more information in the
3:50
header you don't need to know what is in
3:52
the header yet okay but here you can say
3:55
okay I add some header it's called HT
3:58
okay and then now this entire thing
4:02
is called a segment or datagram
4:06
depending on what kind of protocol
4:07
you're using if you're using UDP then
4:10
that's datagram if you are using TCP
4:12
then that's called segment but usually
4:14
we just call segmented transport layer
4:16
okay
4:17
then again this message needs to travel
4:21
down this now this segment needs to
4:24
travel down to another layer below why
4:28
because we need to send it out right so
4:31
then we I mean it comes down to another
4:34
layer to the network layer we need to
4:37
add some
4:38
Network a little header it's like we are
4:43
adding another envelope outside
4:46
the envelope of a transpose layer does
4:49
this make sense
4:51
so we add another let me wrap it again
4:54
okay and this time on the on the outer
4:58
outside or outside envelope we will we
5:03
will uh write down some information
5:05
about the IP address
5:08
so this is from uh Sacramento to some
5:14
place in in New York okay it's like that
5:16
so we need to write down the IP
5:18
information and of course there are
5:21
other information included in the
5:22
network header okay so this is a network
5:25
layer header
5:26
and now we can keep call this thing as a
5:29
packet so you can say in networking we
5:31
usually say oh packet packet but packet
5:33
is actually an hour clear thing if we
5:36
make this very formal okay
5:40
and then when it comes down to a layer
5:42
below
5:44
okay
5:45
this is a link layer we need to again
5:48
add some link layer header so it's like
5:51
we are adding another envelope outside
5:54
of the all the envelopes okay so it's a
5:57
like we are wrapping it again again
6:00
later on later okay it's like an onion
6:03
so now we have uh this is a thing called
6:06
frame so if the frame has a header
6:09
called link layer header okay
6:12
the frame will add some information like
6:15
the MAC address what is the source Mac
6:17
address what is the destination map
6:19
address
6:20
okay
6:21
uh so you may not know what is a MAC
6:24
address you don't need to know now I
6:27
think some of you may have already heard
6:29
this term before right so what is the
6:31
MAC address for device usually each
6:33
device has a unique Mac address
6:36
okay
6:38
um there are more information included
6:39
in the link layer header but Mac address
6:42
is the most important one or most
6:45
important piece okay
6:47
then eventually this Frame is sent to
6:50
the physical layer
6:52
and this becomes zeros and ones okay
6:56
send it out
6:59
so you can see how it travels
7:02
it's very interesting actually it comes
7:04
to the physical layer
7:06
and then goes down to the it goes up to
7:08
the link layer so why
7:10
because
7:13
these are these signals are zeros and
7:15
ones right of course it will firstly
7:17
come to the physical year
7:19
because they all arrived at the zeros
7:22
and ones right and then we pass it down
7:25
to up layer to link layer the link layer
7:27
will
7:29
um
7:30
sorry pass it up to nuclear the nuclear
7:33
will do some process here and then pass
7:35
it down again to the physical layer
7:38
becomes zero the ones when it arrives at
7:41
the router okay it's the same process it
7:45
arrives at zeros and ones okay then we
7:49
when it comes to the link layer when
7:51
this this uh
7:53
frame come to link layer okay and now
7:56
you can see what will happen is very
7:58
interesting the link layer the router
8:01
will will read the link layer header
8:03
you'll see oh this is to this Mac
8:05
address okay and then this header will
8:08
be removed
8:10
so then what is passed to the up layer
8:14
is actually we only have these ones left
8:17
each n h t and M
8:21
so you can see the link layer header is
8:23
removed and the network network layer
8:26
will read the network layer header like
8:29
oh what is the address okay
8:32
then this layer will this header will be
8:35
removed
8:37
okay so we have only h t and M left
8:41
um so
8:43
the router may add a new network layer
8:48
header when it comes down to the link
8:50
layer one the link layer will add a new
8:53
header link layer header okay so it
8:56
becomes zeros and ones again and then
8:59
pass it to the destination B
9:02
so again it becomes zeros and ones and
9:07
physical error at B B will convert this
9:11
and pass this up to nuclear link layer
9:14
will read the link layer header remove
9:17
this
9:19
okay positive to network layer it's like
9:22
open the envelope the
9:26
outside layer of envelope then it comes
9:30
down to the to comes up to the network
9:32
layer Network layer will read the header
9:35
Network layer header remove this header
9:39
okay and then pass what is inside to the
9:42
transport layer then transport delivery
9:43
the header and remove it finally the
9:46
message is passed to the application
9:48
here
9:48
so it's like the only again it's like
9:51
the onion we have Ionia we remove one
9:54
layer and another layer and then another
9:56
layer finally we see the the message in
9:59
the core okay oh it's like
10:02
um a letter that is wrapped with
10:04
multiple multi-layers of envelope so we
10:06
remove the envelope one by one okay
10:09
finally we see the method inside okay so
10:12
this is uh the entire process explains
10:15
how the message is sent and received and
10:19
uh in this entire process we see the
10:22
concept of encapsulation
10:24
okay
10:26
any questions so far hope you are not
10:29
all around
10:31
yeah I just wanted to clarify so when I
10:34
go to into the router it peel off the HL
10:37
and then it somehow get the HL again and
10:40
then when it comes to the destination
10:42
apiol of the HL one more time
10:46
uh good question you mean here yes we
10:49
need to get this get rid of this HL
10:51
right and then
10:54
so after we get rid of this HL and when
10:58
it comment comes down to comes to the
11:01
left part actually uh it's like it's
11:04
passing up to the network layer right
11:06
and then uh we need in the network layer
11:10
will do some process then it comes down
11:12
to link layer link layer will add a new
11:15
HL so although they are all called HL
11:18
but they are different hl's so yeah in
11:23
the HL the HL so for example a ringtone
11:25
in the MAC address is uh is a is a the
11:29
definition and Mac address is probably
11:30
this router okay but now the router will
11:34
change the destination Mac address into
11:36
uh the into B's Mac address
11:39
okay so that's why this HL is actually a
11:42
new HL
11:44
okay it's different from the one here on
11:48
the right on the right a right side of
11:50
the router
11:51
but when this message
11:54
when this entire thing is sent to here
11:56
to be okay so this each L is the same as
12:00
this one
12:02
and why does it have what's the
12:04
difference between those HL uh
12:08
this one this HL as I said is the same
12:11
as this HL
12:12
okay because uh it's simply this thing
12:16
this entire thing
12:17
is the past to be okay so it's still the
12:21
same thing that the HL is the same thing
12:23
and then this link layer will will read
12:27
this HL
12:28
and then remove this HL then pass what
12:32
is inside to the ARP layer
12:35
that doesn't make sense yeah yeah thank
12:37
you okay great
12:41
uh other questions
12:45
one question in the chat is is the link
12:48
layer created by the network layer
12:53
do you mean the link clear header or the
12:55
link layer yeah
12:57
um
12:59
I was just going to say does does it
13:02
strip the the link when it gets to a
13:04
router it strips the link
13:06
um layer off and then reads the network
13:09
layer to create a new link to the next
13:10
destination is that how it works
13:13
then puts the header back up top once it
13:15
has a new heading
13:18
um so here what what will happen is it
13:21
will read the link layer header let me
13:25
can I can I just
13:27
maybe remove all those drawings so we
13:32
can see it better
13:36
when it comes to the router here this is
13:41
Network layer so let me see
13:48
firstly event arrives it has all those
13:51
four layers headers link near header
13:53
Network layer header transport layer
13:55
header and the message itself okay then
13:59
the link layer header can only be
14:02
understood by the link layer
14:05
so you can think about this the the link
14:08
layer uh can understand the link layer
14:10
right so that's why the link layer
14:12
header can be understood by only the
14:14
link layer
14:15
it will it's it doesn't contain any
14:19
information that is useful for other
14:21
layers
14:22
okay so then the link layer will just
14:25
read the information from the link layer
14:27
header and after the information is used
14:30
it's not when link layer knows
14:33
what what is happening who is the uh
14:36
receiving Mac address the link layer can
14:38
simply remove this header and pass it to
14:41
our player okay
14:44
but when but you know you know because
14:47
of this this this entire thing
14:49
still has to be passed down to the lower
14:52
layer in order to transcend it out we
14:55
still need to become zeros and ones
14:57
that's why when it comes down to the
15:00
link layer again
15:02
then we have to add a new link layer
15:04
header
15:06
Okay add another Link at layer header so
15:09
some of you may ask why do we do that
15:12
okay because okay this uh as weeks and
15:16
explain more and learn more especially
15:19
when we talk about the link layer okay
15:21
then you will understand
15:22
sometimes we need to change the MAC
15:25
address in between
15:27
okay so because the link layer is DNA
15:31
with only the neighbors okay dealing
15:33
with only the neighbors for example if
15:35
I'm the uh the sender okay if let's see
15:39
a question is uh my direct neighbor okay
15:43
then I'll put the MAC address or
15:47
question
15:48
as the link layer as the destination Mac
15:52
address
15:53
okay as the destination Mac address
15:56
but actually eventually this letter is
15:59
going to let's say going to Michael
16:02
okay eventually this letter is going to
16:05
Michael then my the first Mac address I
16:08
use is probably Christian Mac address
16:10
then
16:12
when Christian received this Christian
16:14
needs to replace the MAC address to
16:18
his direct neighbor okay so probably his
16:21
direct neighbor is a Victor so then
16:24
he will change the link layer address
16:27
the MAC address into Victor's Mac
16:29
address
16:30
okay and then again so so you can see in
16:35
this process where we how to change the
16:37
Mac addresses sometimes we have to
16:40
change some of the information in
16:41
between that's why we actually we are
16:43
changing the link layer header
16:46
okay we are adding a new header and then
16:49
this entire thing is passed to here then
16:53
the definition will remove the headers
16:55
layer by layer
16:57
you can imagine okay you can imagine you
17:01
have a letter
17:02
okay the letter is wrapped
17:07
the letter is wrapped again and again
17:10
and again okay for different layers to
17:13
understand
17:14
okay it's wrapped with different
17:16
envelopes okay then when it comes to
17:20
specific layer
17:22
the layer can only read the envelope
17:25
information
17:26
for this specific layer
17:30
okay so for example the link layer
17:35
the link layer
17:37
can only read the envelope information
17:40
from here after it reads the information
17:44
then it doesn't need this layer anymore
17:46
it doesn't need this envelope anymore so
17:49
then this envelope is removed
17:52
the inside is passed to the up layer
17:55
okay
17:56
then of course if we want to send it out
18:00
okay
18:01
send this entire thing this entire
18:03
letter out again we have to add another
18:05
envelope nuclear envelope
18:08
okay so when it comes down comes to the
18:12
um destination then again we remove the
18:15
envelope layer by layer
18:18
okay finally we can see the inside it's
18:20
like that
18:22
um for now we didn't cover we didn't
18:25
mention anything about the routing we I
18:27
mean in this entire process there's no
18:30
routing kind of thing because we
18:34
um we are purely talking about what rock
18:36
there is only one way one route this is
18:40
purely going through this a to S to R
18:44
and then to B
18:46
okay we didn't talk talk about oh how
18:49
about we change to another different
18:51
route it's like we are talking about
18:54
only from Sacramento
18:57
to New York
19:00
okay we are going through probably let's
19:03
see Chicago
19:06
but we didn't mention a different route
19:10
that go through La we we we we
19:14
here we simplify the problem we say okay
19:17
let's see just let's just look at this
19:19
route what will happen it's like this
19:22
because we we have we do not have any
19:25
um
19:26
we do not have any more knowledge yet so
19:29
at the very beginning when we talk about
19:31
all these different layers how this will
19:33
work this is uh probably a little bit
19:35
overwhelming and very abstract okay
19:40
um but gradually gradually just keep
19:42
this in your mind this is how we work
19:44
how this latest kind of thing work okay
19:48
keep it in your mind and gradually when
19:50
we learn more about the each layer okay
19:53
then you will understand how the entire
19:56
thing works we are going to talk about
19:58
uh the now
