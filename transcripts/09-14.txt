0:01
each layer okay then you will understand how the entire thing works we are going
0:08
to talk about uh the network security okay security is actually uh now a very
0:14
important aspect in networking and we will not go deep into the security but
0:20
we will uh we will only introduce some of the basic concepts very common attack
0:26
types things like that if you want to know more about security
0:32
um you uh and we later in this class we will still uh when we introduce some of
0:37
the applications or some of the protocols we will still talk about
0:43
security if they are related but anyway in this class the major focus
0:49
is not security so if you are really interested in this topic then you should
0:55
take 154 the security class okay all right so let's see
1:04
so basically uh for network security we are talking about the attack and defense
1:10
most of the time okay um in the network security field we we
1:16
are really interested in how the bad guys uh can attack the computer networks how
1:24
can they achieve the attack the tax okay and then how we can defend the network
1:29
attacks against this uh the networks against the net attacks basically we
1:35
always have attackers and Defenders usually most of the Enterprise networks
1:40
have dedicated groups or teams security teams to
1:45
work uh against the attackers basically they will deploy some security sensors
1:51
some of the defending tools like firewalls detection tools so they they
1:59
can protect the network better okay so this is a what what will happen What
2:04
happens in the Enterprise Networks and then people also didn't also think about
2:09
how to design the architecture that are immune to a text this is actually I
2:15
would say um a topic that will be there forever okay
2:21
so it's really hard it's really hard to design an architecture a network
2:27
architecture that are immune to our text based on especially because we are building this network this internet
2:34
without Security in mind so you can think about it there are a lot of Legacy
2:39
issues right so we designed the network in this way without secreting in mind and now if you want to completely change
2:46
the architecture to make it immune to our taxes so I would say it's very very challenging it's very hard okay
2:53
um so originally people really don't think about security they just when we when we first saw
3:00
Vision the internet uh people just think this is a a group of mutually trusted
3:06
users attached to a transparent Network this is really if you you stand at this
3:12
point right now you will see oh okay this version is really innocent right it's really a naive but um
3:21
at that time when network was firstly designed people do things like that okay
3:26
until until some naughty high school students began to do something back to
3:32
the network and then people realize oh okay this kind of vacation actions can
3:38
really really um lead to some disasters in networking
3:43
okay so then the Internet Protocol designers are now playing the catch-up games
3:49
basically we want to improve this protocol in this way in that way to make
3:55
the networking more secure okay more secure but still as I said it's it's
4:00
very challenging okay that's why the cyber security right now is actually a
4:05
very Hot Topic in the research area okay very hot topics
4:10
um and if uh if you have some background in security when you are looking for a
4:16
job you definitely stand out from the others okay so um some of you may may ask that if we
4:25
consider security where should we consider security we learned the five layers right five Internet Protocol
4:32
stack layers um we have application near transport layer Network layer link layer physical
4:39
layer then where should we put security as I mentioned this is actually a
4:44
drawback or layer the layer kind of architecture right so security does not fit to one specific layer okay so
4:54
security must be considered in all different layers we need all layers from
4:59
application layer to the physical layer so this is something you have to keep in
5:04
mind foreign what is the goal of the bad guys
5:12
okay basically their goal is to put the malware into the hose here the horse
5:19
with me all the different Computing devices like computers iPads tablets right so mobile phones all
5:28
those kind of things so put malware into the host via internet
5:33
okay this is a this is basically the goal of the attackers okay so the
5:41
malware can actually get into house in different ways for example they can get into the house in virus
5:48
or worn so what what are those virus is basically no matter it's a virus or one
5:56
we all know this is just a program right so virus and worm are just a piece of
6:01
code okay but they have different they have difference okay the virus
6:08
um basically can do self-replicating infection by receiving and executing the object okay so what
6:16
does this mean this means usually for example when you see a virus when you um
6:22
usually but this virus I really hidden in some kind of software right in
6:28
some kind of software or other files so it is usually
6:35
hidden and when I say hey I mean you cannot tell this is a virus by look just
6:41
looking at this look at this file okay so for example sometimes you may receive an email and the email saying hey uh
6:50
please click on that attachment I have some important files for you things like
6:55
that and once you click on that then this virus this is making this
7:01
attachment may contain the virus and then these virus may start the self-replicating process okay and you
7:09
can see in this process in this process other person or other people's actions
7:17
are very important okay if you do not click on this button
7:22
if you do need do not click on this attachment then wires can do nothing but if you click on this attachment then
7:29
the virus can start the self-replicity so that means the user or the internet
7:35
user innocent user's interaction is actually very important for the
7:41
self-replicating a virus okay but for warm warm is different okay warm
7:49
can do self-replicating infection by passively receiving the object that gets
7:55
itself executed in this process we do not need any actions from the users we
8:02
do not need any action from the innocent healer that's something you need to keep in mind okay
8:08
there are actually a lot of different types of worms some are very famous I
8:14
remember when I was still in China some um there there was one worm I cannot
8:20
remember them but I I deeply remember the how the computer behave after it is
8:28
infected so it's very interesting when the computer was infected then
8:33
everything is gone and the computer just has just display uh
8:40
a panda just play a panda there um so
8:46
um I can't describe this very accurately but uh panda is doing something there on
8:52
the on the computer so nothing else is displayed on the computer and it doesn't react to any of the actions from the
9:00
users um for this kind of warm so it it's only
9:05
uses it only uses uh it basically it will
9:11
only take advantage of the vulnerabilities on the computer okay it
9:17
doesn't need any actions from uh from the from the user okay so that's the
9:23
difference between warm and virus I may ask you the difference in the test
9:29
okay there is another type of malware called spyware spyware is actually very
9:35
useful and very um obviously very scary okay so spyware
9:42
can record the case jokes the websites visited um and basically all the actions that
9:51
you have already taken on the machine and then upload those information to some collection site so you think about
9:57
this if you type in a website like a bank a bank like chase.com okay and then
10:06
you begin to type in some username and password then this
10:12
kind of spiral is able to remember what website you have visited and what
10:18
letters you have typed into so then of course we can know the username and
10:24
password right so that is a harmful to the users okay
10:30
um so that is another type so some of you may ask what can they do
10:37
what can the attackers do if they get the house infected no matter using
10:44
Wireless or warm so what can they do so they can do a lot of things if they
10:52
compromise a machine okay you think about this one thing is as I said
10:57
probably they can install some spyware to monitor what you have already done
11:03
okay so they can steal your credentials that's one thing another thing is they
11:09
can control your machine right so actually in fact your machine they can
11:16
um so they can work as like administrator they they may say if so
11:22
for example if in if your motion is a Linux system then they can type in some commands Okay they can type in some
11:29
commands um then ask the machine to execute okay so for example they can send the very
11:37
important files back to the collection site back to the attackers or especially
11:44
if this machine is a very important machine like if this she is the
11:49
workstation used by a CEO of a company right so then this CEO's machine may
11:56
have a lot of uh important files like Financial files or other type of files
12:03
then attackers are able to to collect those information to uh to have some
12:11
Financial gains those kind of things right uh and we can they can also do other things okay for example you may
12:18
say oh my machine does not have this kind of a very important
12:23
um in files or information so I don't need to care about this you still need to care about this
12:29
because um these attackers May May control your machine and use your
12:36
machine to do something okay so for example even they can use your CPUs your
12:43
Computing resources okay to do something back or they can control your machine to
12:49
get your machine enrolled in the botnet so what is a botnet bottleneck means a
12:54
net worth of bots so a network of sleeves basically your machine is like a
13:00
sleeve or a bot that can be used for a lot of things like spam like Adidas
13:06
attacks okay so for example sending out spam emails or conducting DDOS attacks
13:13
so probably you do not understand what is DDOS we are going to introduce this in this slide so before I introduce DDOS
13:21
details sorry details means distributed foreign
13:31
distributive denial service that is DDOS okay before I introduce the distributed
13:39
denial Services let's first we talk about the denial service okay only does
13:45
so what is the noun service attack uh basically the now service means that
13:50
attackers make the resources resources here with me the server the Computing
13:56
resources the bandwidth making these resources and available to
14:02
legitimate traffic by by overwhelming resource with Focus traffic
14:08
so what does this mean this means so for example this is a server right so
14:15
this target here is a server when we see a server we mean the server is serving a
14:22
number of clients okay so for example you think about the Google web server so it is serving the
14:30
clients all over the world or you think about the sac State's web server it is serving all the Sac State
14:38
faculty and staff and students right so those servers are serving the clients
14:46
okay and then we want to if this is serving the clients we want to make sure the service is available to everybody
14:54
okay it's available to everybody then but one day if the server the the
15:00
service cannot be available to someone then this is problematic okay for
15:05
example if you one day you want to visit the website for Sac State you cannot you
15:10
cannot visit it then you you will feel bad right or if one day you cannot use Google then you will feel frustrated so
15:18
that's that's why we want to make the service available to everybody so what's the the attacker will do in
15:25
the denial service attack is firstly it will select a Target
15:31
okay then the attackers will break into the house
15:37
around the network okay so for example you can say those ones are all
15:44
compromised by the attackers now these computers becomes
15:50
the Bots It all becomes the sleeves so they will
15:55
basically follow all the commands by the master the master here is uh is a machine
16:02
controlled by the attacker okay so after that after that then the
16:10
attacker will send the package to the target from the compromise house so you
16:16
can say there are so many computers controlled by the attacker they can send
16:23
packets to the Target at the same time okay simultaneously can we can do this
16:28
at the same time then in this case the server does not know the server pay
16:35
attention the server does not know that this request this packets are from
16:41
malicious machines the server will just treat them as legitimate users innocent
16:47
users okay then the server will try to serve all these machines or to to get
16:56
respect to respond to all those requests okay
17:02
then in this case as you can see because the server is too busy with those
17:08
malicious requests how what if if there is one innocent user who also want to
17:16
get service from the server could the server still reply back the server
17:22
cannot okay the server does not have the capacity to reply back to the client
17:31
okay so that's that's that means the server is actually denying denying to
17:39
serve the client that's why we call this as denial or service attack
17:44
does this make sense so it's like for example if I'm uh I'm
17:50
having office hours okay I have office hours to all the students in our class
17:56
if one day okay if one day let's say we have some bad guy let's see Alex is a
18:03
is the bad guy who controlled most of our students in
18:09
this class Alex yes sorry for using you as an
18:14
example okay um so let's say um
18:24
um so let's say Alex Now controls most of the students in our class and he he
18:30
sent uh this this bad students to my office hours and each student will I
18:38
mean they all stay there for very very long time so then I'm fully occupied by
18:43
these bad students right then in this case if we have a good student let's see
18:50
uh Aaron comes in Ira is a good student so he wants to see me to get help so can
18:57
I still help Aaron I cannot right so this is the denial service to
19:04
Aaron and all the other students actually okay
19:11
um so that's what we call as denial service attack so actually what I I'm describing here
19:19
is a you can you can view it as a distributed uh denial service because
19:25
you can see all those requests are distributed into different machines
19:33
okay into different machines this is already distributed in our service attack so some of you may think that
19:39
what is the now service attack in our service attack is uh basically what we
19:45
mean is a for example if we have Alex again as the bad guy so Alex come to my
19:51
office hour and ask me uh millions of questions okay
19:57
so then I'm too busy with Alex I have to answer all his questions then in this
20:04
case in this case I cannot serve anybody else right so so basically the attack
20:09
the attack is from Alex itself only one machine is sending a lot of requests
20:16
okay that is the now service attack but for denial of service attack I would say it's it's kind of easy to block to to
20:23
prevent or to uh to address this issue for example if I know Alex is is a bad
20:30
guy then I can simply say oh I recognize you you are you are the bad guy I I won't let you come
20:37
to my office hour okay it's very easy to plug
20:42
um similarly if we say one machine if we see one machine is making a lot more requests to the server then we can
20:50
simply block that machine because we can easily we can easily tell the IP address
20:55
of that machine okay we can just block the track traffic from this machine so it's very easy
21:01
but for distribution uh denial Service as you can see because the traffic is
21:06
coming from all different users okay although they are all malicious users
21:12
but they are coming from all different IP addresses How can I block them we cannot because it's very
21:19
hard to tell which ones are innocent which ones are not innocent okay which
21:24
ones are malicious it's very hard to tell that's why distributed denial service attack is actually much harder
21:31
to prevent than denial service attack and
21:36
in the test I may ask you what is the denial service attack okay or what is a distributed now
21:43
service attack so you should know um the definition here okay
21:51
the next question the next topic is about packet sniffing so what is packing
21:56
sniffy Pakistani means if we have two computers talking to each other
22:03
okay and these two computers they need to use some kind of uh media right or
22:09
sometimes men or many times they have to use like broadcast media like uh the
22:14
shared Ethernet or the wireless network okay for example when we use Wi-Fi when
22:20
a is sending some information to basically everybody in this network can
22:28
receive the package from a so it's called broadcasting media okay then in
22:34
this case in this case if we have some bad guy here like C
22:40
which can record all the packets passing by
22:46
okay that is a uh that that will generate some negative impacts so what
22:53
does this mean you can think about this the bad guy C if it can listen to all
23:00
the package then it is able to capture all the information inside the package
23:05
right for example here if B is sending a package to a The Source IP address is B
23:13
destination IP address is a and the payload payload contains some input important
23:21
information usually okay for example the payload may include the password okay so some of you may think
23:28
how could the password be included right or
23:34
are the password encrypted let me tell you the truth
23:39
many times for many applications actually the passwords are passed or are
23:47
sent out in plain text you cannot imagine this many of the
23:53
times when you look at a package you can easily find out the passwords okay
23:59
that's very important then if C is able to find out the
24:04
password then C can do a lot of things right if a is the server like let's see
24:11
a a bank or some other website then C can easily use the password
24:16
of B to sign in this webpage to basically do anything she wants
24:24
okay so that's why Tech sniffing is actually very important
24:30
um and as I said not all the applications encrypt the data no many
24:37
many of the applications simply did not encrypt the data okay that's very important that's actually why in one of
24:45
my 153 plus some students did a course project
24:51
to use the Wi-Fi okay they just go to Starbucks or those kind of public Wi-Fi
24:57
to set up a fake Wi-Fi okay uh this week I Wi-Fi is free to
25:06
everybody so if you connect to that okay if you connect to that then that
25:12
um Wi-Fi will basically collect all the payloads all the pack is going through
25:17
then in this case they are able to look into the confidential information
25:23
contained in this uh packets so that's a that's my very interesting thing so some
25:30
of you may think oh the proximity is mainly used for
25:35
um malicious uh intent I would say no sometimes the the specs sniffing can
25:42
also be used for some good uses okay so or at least it's neutral okay it can
25:49
be for gold or it can be for bad okay it's packaged sniffing legal it depends
25:57
okay depends so if you are using let's so what I'm going to introduce uh right
26:03
now is actually the Wireshark software and you are actually going to use software shock to do a lab
26:10
um in our class the Wireshark software is a packet sniffer okay it's a package
26:18
name for it is it is uh it's installed on your machine okay you can install it
26:23
on your machine or some other people's motion if they allow you to do so then
26:29
if you enable capturing the packets all the pack is going through
26:36
all the pack is coming to a machine or going out your from your machine will be
26:41
captured by Workshop okay now you are actually sniffing uh to pack sniffing on
26:47
your own machine so obviously this is legal okay this is of course legal but sometimes if you want to do packing
26:54
sniffing on some other machines um especially for those big companies uh
27:01
that may not be legal okay that's the difference and later you are going to learn more
27:08
about my shock okay so basically why in my shock you are able to capture uh most of the all
27:16
the packets okay and then you can see especially for example if you connect to
27:22
a website uh or if you send out an email so all the traffic are captured and you
27:28
are able to see uh what is the IP address the source IP address doesn't IP address what is the phone number used so
27:36
what are the payloads um and you can even see the protocols used at each layer and later as I said
27:43
in the Wireshark lab you are going to learn more about this tool okay so the last one we are going to
27:50
introduce in our class is uh IPS spoofing so what does this mean IP spoofing
27:57
basically means send in packet with Force Source address
28:04
okay so this for example if a and b again are
28:10
talking to each other okay now b c is the bad guy
28:16
C can pretend to be a b okay so you can
28:22
pretend to be B and then send a package to a okay here you can see it is saying
28:29
the source I Source address is B the destination address is a and it's sending some payload then what a reply
28:36
when a reply a will directly reply to the source okay what our source is put
28:42
there it will reply to this source so a we are simply reply to
28:48
see directly okay okay to say directly because say is now
28:56
using pretending to BB using this IP address right so then any of your think
29:01
C is uh the um say is the sauce Source a will reply
29:08
back to C okay so then all the basically C is able to capture the package to be
29:15
um or we can say hijack the package to be okay so most of the time most of the
29:23
time you may see why do we do this why do why does c do this why does c do the
29:28
my piece moving is like pretending to be someone else
29:34
okay so basically if C pretends to be B then C can do a lot of things in the
29:40
name of B okay many many times and many times IPS
29:45
buffing can be used together with packets packet sniffing how can we do
29:51
that so if you look at this slide again say can basically if a is talking to B
29:58
Okay C can basically listen to their conversation and then find then capture
30:04
these packets okay capture this package and see we all know what is the payload Etc
30:12
so especially for example if you see if a is asking for some information from B
30:19
to authenticate B okay it's like for example what is your
30:24
mother's maiden name let's see although in networking uh this usually this is
30:30
another question right but we I think I want to make make your uh clear about how this works so let's just use this
30:37
example if a is asking maybe what is the middle uh the your mother's maiden name
30:43
okay only B knows the answer C does not know right but what a c can do is see
30:51
listening to their conversation and then see basically get this package
30:58
in this package B is telling a what is the middle name so let's say the middle
31:03
name is X okay then now C note oh okay B's mother
31:10
has a maiden name of ads then C can use this
31:17
X okay to answer the question of a
31:22
a question from a if C is doing this much faster than b
31:28
okay then a will basically accept the first the first packet
31:33
coming to a and then of course here see we also pretend to be
31:39
B okay then Aerials think if you think C is B okay maybe I'll think oh I'm still
31:47
talking to B and then a will reply to C and C oh okay you are authenticated then
31:53
now what do you want to do okay then say Oh say like okay let me withdraw 1000
31:58
bucks okay then C can withdraw money from uh B's account
32:03
so that is what will happen um so what I'm talking about now is actually called The Man in the middle
32:10
attack
32:17
okay MIM nine in the middle attack basically
32:22
basically C is the mat in the middle C is able to do a lot of bad things by
32:31
firstly Listening to A and B's conversation and then pretending to be B
32:37
uh to get authenticated and then talk today okay so the my middle mind the middle
32:44
attack is a very very common in security and it's actually very challenging uh
32:51
type of attack that that can happen in very in very different scenarios so a
32:59
lot of research are working on how to prevent this kind of attacks okay
33:05
uh that's all about the security Parts I think we are done with chapter one
