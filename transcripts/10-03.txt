0:02
the the next very interesting topic which is uh DNS the name name service
0:10
okay so we all know that uh as a person we
0:15
have many identifiers we have for example we have the um SSN
0:21
okay we have the name and we have also password numbers okay
0:28
um then for um computers computers also have some name called IP address you can use you
0:34
you can view this uh as a type of identifier right IP address and the
0:42
computers also have names like yahoo.com google.com Okay those names are commonly
0:50
used by humans so you may ask why do we have the names if we have IP address why
0:56
do we need the the host names so it's like we know each person's SSN
1:03
why do we still need a name for for that person if we know Michael's SSN is one two
1:10
three four five okay why do we need a Michael the name Michael for for him
1:17
it's very easy to remember Michael but it's very hard to remember Michael's assassin right we have to use IP address
1:23
for roughly and everything but we also need uh easily understandable
1:30
name for that host okay because you can you can remember yahoo.com you can remember google.com
1:37
it's very easy to type in but it's not easy to remember the 32-bit IP address
1:44
okay then the question is the question now becomes how can we map between the
1:51
IP address and the hostname otherwise it wasn't the answer is called the mean
1:57
name system okay so we need something called domain name system to remember
2:03
the mapping between IP address and name okay actually actually when we mentioned
2:09
DNS it implies two things one thing is a distributed database that means in this
2:16
database we need to store the mappings between IP address
2:21
and the name okay this is this distribute database is actually
2:26
implemented in the hierarchy of many name servers okay but DNS also has
2:33
another menu that means um the application layer for Toko this
2:39
allowed the house to query the distributed database okay so this is another thing we are
2:45
going to learn in this class so now let's look at what kind of
2:50
services can be provided by DS so the first thing that comes into your
2:56
mind is probably the mapping between the hostname and IP address right host name
3:01
to IP address translation actually vs does much more than that
3:08
okay so there are three more other functions that are provided by the DNS
3:13
first one host Alice house editing for what does this mean this means uh for
3:20
each cost it may have a canonical name and also a A-list name for example the
3:26
canonical name is relay one or really or whatever that's West
3:32
Coast dot enterprise.com this is the canonical name but the Alias
3:39
name that is too long right nobody's going to remember that but the Alias name can be Enterprise outcome or www
3:46
dot enterprise.com which are much easier to remember
3:52
okay so that is actually the uh aliasing it provides a host a lesson okay and it
3:59
also provides the mail server Alice okay that means the mail server may have
4:05
a very long name but we can also give it a short Alias to remember it easily
4:11
if you still remember in the demo of email we actually use the
4:18
we actually used the alaci um
4:23
do you see this telnet
4:29
smtp.csus.edu this smtp.csus.edu is actually a ALS
4:37
the real name for this server is this one smtp.settling.csus.edu
4:47
okay that's the real name is longer okay it's longer than that
4:53
um that's the third type okay third additional type the last one
5:00
that can be done by the DNS is called the load distribution okay load
5:06
distribution um as you can imagine for those big companies okay the web server the web
5:13
server may be accessed um a lot you imagine about google.com
5:20
amazon.com right so it's usually it's not possible to
5:26
have just one web server serving for all the uh clients it's not possible right
5:34
so in this case what can we do what we can do is we give it to just the one
5:41
name okay one name like google.com but we actually assign multiple IP addresses to
5:49
this one name okay then in this case when people access google.com Okay then we can kind
5:58
of distribute the load to google.com to many different IP addresses okay that
6:04
means to many different machines okay so this is called load distribution
6:09
so that's another service that can be done by DNS okay
6:15
so then the next question we need to consider is oh how can we how can we deploy this DNS
6:23
system can we just use one centralized server
6:29
it's like for for example web application can we just use one
6:34
centralized DNS server so we cannot do that for a number of
6:40
reasons the first is single point of failure that means if this server is down okay
6:47
then we cannot provide DNS service for the entire world
6:52
okay then in this case the entire internet system this is very important because you can you can think about this
7:00
for all the clients around or whatever if they want to communicate usually they
7:07
need the answers the answer is essential okay nobody's going to type in IP
7:13
address they all type in the hostname okay if the DS service is not there
7:20
is uh the entire internet is going it's going it's going down okay this is even
7:26
worse than for example a web service a web server is down it can probably only
7:32
impact one specific company and the clients to that specific company but if
7:38
this uh the answer is done then it will impact this entire internet for the
7:45
entire world okay and another thing we need to consider is if we have one single server then the
7:52
traffic volume is is huge This Server can easily be overwhelmed okay
7:58
and then we also need to consider uh where we should put the centralized
8:05
database because everyone wants this to be close to them right but we we do not
8:10
have like a perfect location for the entire world right
8:16
um then the last thing is the maintenance okay if we have one single server this server has to be there
8:22
forever and it has to be up and running forever we cannot afford
8:30
shutting it down to do maintenance we cannot okay so those are all the things
8:35
we need to consider so the major reason to summarize one
8:41
word one sentence it means if we have a single server then it it doesn't scale
8:46
okay so in reality DNS is actually a distributed hierarchical database okay
8:55
um so that means we firstly have the root DN server okay and then the second layer uh
9:05
is called the top flower the mean name servers okay that means they are.com dot
9:12
org.edu okay so those are called top level the new email servers and finally
9:19
the last layer the lowest layer is called the authoritative name servers
9:25
okay authoritative name servers so generally if a clients wants IP address
9:30
for Amazon.com okay uh your relay or
9:36
theoretically the client will need to First Contact the root
9:42
to find the IP address for.com DN server
9:47
and then the client will query the.com DN server to get the
9:53
amazon.com's authoritative DN server okay that means
10:00
from this one we will get the contact of this one okay then finally we go to the
10:07
amazon.com the answer we're together IP address for Amazon.com
10:12
okay so this is like for example for our department
10:17
okay for our department if we have uh Veronica as the authoritative name
10:23
server then the college level we may have somebody there let's see it's our day our day is there as the authority so
10:31
let's see this is the president
10:37
and the women have the thing and we may have let's use the chair okay
10:44
instead of Veronica okay let's say if you want to find a contact
10:50
information for me okay I'm a regular faculty in the department of computer science then you have to contact the
10:57
president say hey do you know the contact information for Dean Daniel for ECS
11:03
quality is of VCS and then you'll find the content and then you get the
11:09
information for the thing and then you cut the thing and asking hey do you have the contact information for the chair
11:15
and the final encounter the chair to get the contact number for me so that is the entire process
11:21
okay so it's hierarchical um if we look at the name server the
11:27
root name servers we for the entire world okay for the entire world we have
11:33
13 logical root name servers worldwide okay
11:39
as a marketing this map um when we say logical servers that
11:45
means um while minority console does not really mean one physical server and one logical
11:52
server can have many many uh physical
11:57
servers okay it's just viewed as one server but as you can imagine
12:03
Apparently one physical server is not sufficient to serve the entire world right
12:10
um so basically the root name server context The Authority name server if
12:16
named mapping is not known okay to get the mapping and then the root names will
12:23
return the mapping to the local name server okay so um and we just mentioned the top level
12:29
domain server which is the second layer okay servers are responsible for.com org net
12:39
edu etc etc okay and it's also for all top level country domain names okay that
12:45
means like UK from CA um Japan okay
12:52
um so this organization this company Network
12:57
Solutions maintains the servers for.com TLD okay and for DOT edu is add your course
13:05
maintaining the top level domain servers okay for the authoritative uh DNS servers
13:13
which is the lowest layer okay each organization will maintain their own
13:19
authoritative DNS server okay the organization's own DNS servers
13:26
provide the authoritative hostname to IP mapping for the organization's name has
13:33
this means for example for sex States we have our own authoritative DN server the
13:39
reason we call it authoritative because only this DNS server knows the correct
13:46
mapping between IP address and house name for all the host e exact States
13:53
okay and authoritative the answer can be maintained by the organization or the
14:00
service provider okay those are the Third type of service
14:07
and there is one more time called the local DNS so low code DNS does not strictly belong
14:15
to hierarchy okay um so each ISP
14:22
has a one local DNS so for example for succeed we also have local DS so what is local dnf
14:30
what is the difference between look audience and and this one here so the local DNS is like the one
14:39
uh survey all the queries from this
14:44
organization for example safe State local DS will serve all the clients in within
14:53
succeed if you for example you want to know the uh IP address for google.com
14:58
you will ask a local DS and then local DNS will try to find out the answer for
15:05
you okay so that is the uh the local DS
15:11
my horse makes DNS query the query is sent to its local DS server so yeah some
15:17
of you may ask what is the difference between local DNS and authoritative DNS so authoritative DNS is is the one
15:25
maintaining the contact list okay but the local DNS is the one
15:33
answering your queries so it's like for our computer science
15:38
department probably the chair is the one maintaining the contact list for all the
15:44
faculty but if you want to ask the contact contact information for other faculty in
15:51
other universities you have to contact the let's say Veronica in this case
15:56
Veronica is the local DNA server okay she is helping you helping you to
16:03
find out the contact information for others does this make sense okay it's like the
16:10
chair is maintaining uh or the low the authority of DNS is
16:15
maintaining all the IP address and host name mapping for all the machines with
16:20
insect State okay but if you want to query about something like amazon.com
16:26
like ebay.com google.com Okay then you have to contact the local DS server okay
16:33
of course sometimes they are combined into one machine especially for small organization and sometimes they are
16:40
separate but they have different functions as you can see they are very different okay
16:46
and the local DS has a local cache of the recent name to address translation
16:51
pairs okay but this may be out of date um it's like
16:57
a proxy this will forward the query into the hierarchy that means uh
17:03
for example if you acquire about google.com and google.com is already cached in local DS then in this case
17:09
local DNS will directly provide you the answer but if google.com is not cached
17:15
in local DS then the local DNS will help you to make the query into the hierarchy
17:22
to basically local the answer will contact the root and ask hey do you know what is the IP address for google.com
17:28
Okay in reality when we do the DNS name resolution we have two ways one type is
17:35
called iterated comparis another type is called recursive query okay now let's
17:40
look at an example we have a requesting host here
17:46
okay cis.poly.edu this one is the requesting host which needs to find out the IP
17:53
address for some machine okay so then that Submachine is this gaia.cs.ums.edu
18:02
so basically the host at CIS of the poly.edu wants the IP address for
18:08
gaia.cs.ums.edu then for Italy the query
18:13
uh basically the contacted server replies with the name of the server to
18:20
contact okay so generally for for the very first step the requesting host will contact
18:27
the local DS okay contact the local DNS and say you
18:34
can see the local DNS is still belongs to poly.teu right so this local DNS
18:40
serves all the machines Within poly.edu
18:45
okay then this requesting host will ask the local DNC hey I want to find out the IP address
18:52
for gaia.cs.umass.edu could you please help me then the local DNS will say sure let me
18:59
help you okay and the local DNS will then contact the root design server
19:06
theoretically it's like this okay it will contact the root design server
19:14
oh I'm sorry I don't know this name okay but I know it belongs to dot edu so
19:24
please go ahead and contact This Server
19:29
okay so basically the root in step 3 the rooting s is returning the contact
19:35
information for DOT edu DN server okay then this local DS for poly.edu
19:44
will go ahead in step four go ahead to ask the dot edu DN server say hey could
19:50
you please help me find out the IP address for this machine and again the dot edu will say oh I'm
19:57
sorry I don't know I don't know the name but I know who you can contact it's like
20:03
the thing is saying hey I don't know but please go ahead to ask the Cs department chair here is the information for the
20:09
department chair okay then basically step five the edu DNS will return the IP
20:17
address for The Authority DNS for
20:22
umass.edu okay and say go ahead to contact that person
20:27
that machine then this in Step six look at the answer will again Ask the authoritative DNS server and say hey
20:34
could you please provide me the IP address for this machine and finally this authoritative DNS
20:42
will provide the IP address to the local audience and then now the local DS is
20:48
Happy local DNC hey I've I completed the work okay local DNS will return this IP
20:55
address to the requesting host okay now eventually that you requesting
21:01
house has the IP address for gaia.cs.umass.edu and then it will
21:07
contact the um it will contact this uh this machine
21:14
for further communication okay uh for example if this machine is a web server
21:19
we know they will continue to do the TCP connection and they will begin to start
21:25
with uh the HTTP request message and response message so this is a one time I uh and you can
21:34
see in this type every time when the server is contacted the server may not know the answer but the server will
21:40
redirect the local DNS to another server who may have the information right
21:48
um in recursive query is different okay in recursive query every server is very
21:55
responsible if the server do not know the information the server will say hey
22:01
please wait here okay hold on wait here and I'll go ahead to find the answer for
22:07
you okay so it's like that every server is very responsible so again you can see
22:14
this is the requesting host okay the requesting host will make a request to the local DNS
22:20
and then locally as well say okay let me find it out for you the local DS will
22:25
then contact the root DS L DNS will say hey I don't know the
22:32
answer but hold on let me find it out for you okay then root will go ahead in step 3
22:39
root will go ahead to contact the tlddsr and TLD will also say hey I don't know
22:46
but hold on wait here and I will find out for you so then in Step 4 TLD will
22:53
directly go ahead to contact the authoritative DNA server of cs.ms.edu
22:58
okay and finally find out the answer so in step five this authoritative DNS
23:06
server from UMass is providing answer to TLD and then TLD prior answer to the
23:12
roots and the final root provide the answer to the local DS okay
23:19
again with this answer local DNS will in Step 8 will provide this answer to the
23:26
requesting host with the cis.poly.edu okay
23:31
um the problem for this recursive query as you can see because every server is
23:38
very responsible so this actually puts the burden of name resolution on the
23:44
contact name server okay as you can imagine because there
23:49
are so many machines that that may contact the root yes then the root yes
23:56
will have very heavy workload because it has to be responsible for all the
24:02
quarries okay it needs to get the answer for all the queries so in this case the
24:09
root yes can be easily overwhelmed okay so that is the problem of the recursive
24:15
query um of course as in the future of course
24:21
now you can you can think about this um later maybe I I'll explain this again
24:26
actually um for the local DS
24:33
the local DNS May cache some answers directly
24:38
for example if you if everyone is visiting google.com
24:44
then the IP address for google.com may have already been cached on the local DS
24:52
okay in this case when a requesting host is requesting IP address for google.com
24:58
the local DNS does not need to do the step three two two to seven it doesn't
25:03
need to do two to seven okay it's it's the same thing here
25:09
same thing here no matter what kind it basically means the query is not needed
25:15
to the root to the TLD to the authoritative DNS server because local DS already knows the answer okay
25:22
um and also also the local DNS may also
25:28
cash the IP address for root and IP address for TLD
25:34
okay why because we do not have a lot of root ntlds
25:40
okay we do not have a lot um so it's very easy for the local DN
25:45
server to Cache those IP addresses it's like you if you already have the
25:51
president and the things contact information okay every time we need to
25:57
do a query you still need to go back to the present you don't need to right you
26:03
don't need to contact the project again to find out the contact information for the thing because the things information
26:09
is already cached at the local DNS okay it's the
26:15
same thing here if the local DS has already cached the root and the TLD
26:21
okay the IP the IP address for TLD then every time when the local DS needs to
26:28
contact a um a TLD server it can go good a good
26:35
content that directly without consulting the root DS okay
26:42
so that is something you need to pay attention um and for the cash okay the cash
26:50
entries time out after some time for this time we call it time to expire TTL
26:56
you probably um are very familiar with TTL right now right so time to leave
27:03
um so the cash has some time uh been there but it will finally
27:09
disappear okay uh and again as I mentioned the TLD server typically caches in the local audience name
27:16
servers okay and also need to pay attention the cash entries may be out of
27:22
date okay um then in this case if for example if
27:27
you imagine one name one host one host okay uh changes the IP address
27:35
then this may not be no internet Wild
27:41
internet wide until all the ttls expire
27:46
okay only after all the ttls higher than everyone knows everyone will everything
27:52
else will uh have the new IP we'll do a new query and
27:58
get the new IP address okay before that this may not be known internet-wide okay
28:04
so those are the information you need to know any questions
28:12
okay um so another thing is about the DNS
28:18
directors okay um so basically as we said the DNS means
28:24
a database then in the database okay in the database um they will store the records of the DS
28:32
okay so how how is the record store it's like this
28:37
foreign the type and the TTL so that is the
28:46
format okay um so basically for the type we have
28:51
four types okay type A which means it's a mapping
28:57
between the name and the hostname and IP address
29:03
okay which means for type A okay
29:09
uh let's see if we have pass.com
29:15
okay and if let's see the IP address is uh
29:22
this is the IP address for test.com then in this case we will have the name
29:29
as task.com this is the machine name okay the value will be the IP address
29:36
and the type is a the TDL can be for example 1000 seconds and this is the
29:43
type aim for type NS type NS in type NS patients the name
29:51
is the domain name and the value is the hostname of authoritative name
29:58
servers for this domain okay so basically we will use Type n s
30:04
to provide uh the the authoritative name
30:10
server for this domain so for it for example again if we have
30:17
foreign
30:26
if the authoritative name server for this dummy is
30:37
dns.test.com then this is type NS
30:44
and the aspiration the TTL can still be housing
30:50
okay this is the name server type the third type the third type is the same name type
30:58
so in this case for say name type the name is the A-list name for some canonical
31:05
name it's the Alias okay again this is a test.com and then the canonical name
31:12
can be
31:28
so this is Type C name
31:35
okay this third type and the fourth type is
31:40
the MX and MX is basically providing the male silver okay for example we can have
32:01
foreign
32:09
types the name and the values are different okay so the last one for test
32:16
outcome the names the mail server is called neo.test.com of course it can be
32:21
other names or other email servers it can be smtp.test.com
32:27
with whatever mail server you have you just put the name there and then this is MX type and the tkl is 1000 okay so this
32:36
will become a test problem in the exam in exam I may ask you to
32:45
write down some records okay for example I give you the domain
32:51
name the IP address the host name and I ask you to provide uh uh maybe NS type
32:58
or whatever type okay so then you need to know how to write this record correctly
33:04
okay questions
33:14
is asking what's the difference between hostname and domain name
33:19
um so hostname hostname is uh the name for
33:26
a machine okay and the mean name is usually um usually means um
33:33
the for example for uh this for this domains the how we reference them in for
33:40
example csus.edu can be a domain name but it can
33:45
also be the host name sometimes okay especially when we use for example we use a
33:52
um csusw to refer to the web server okay but the host name can also be something
33:57
else hostname can also be
34:03
smtp.test.edu.test.com okay then in this case the host name is the hostname for
34:08
this email server okay so um the domain name is like a family
34:14
name okay but sometimes the host name is is just the same as the domain name
34:21
especially for the web server because we usually refer to um for example google.com can be the
34:27
main name and google.com can also be in the host name for the web server Google okay but the mail server and DN server
34:35
database servers may have different names okay
34:41
all right so then let's look at the DNS protocol uh and also the message format
34:47
for DNS the query and reply message they both share the same message format it's
34:53
like that in the in the figure short here in the table short here okay as you can see for the message hacker for the
35:01
message header we have identification number which is a 16 bit number this is
35:07
uh used for query and reply okay so the query and reply message will share the
35:13
same identification number okay to indicate oh this is the reply for that
35:19
specific query okay and then um after that we have two guys of flex
35:26
okay uh another 16 bits is used for Flags in the flags it may indicate this
35:33
is a query or reply message okay and it may indicate uh if recursion is desired or
35:42
uh if your current is available okay and it may also indicate if the reply is
35:49
authoritative or not okay if the reply is authoritative that
35:55
means the reply comes from the authoritative name server directly
36:00
okay if the reply is not authoritative that means the reply is from the local
36:07
DS the cache is from the cache it's not from the original authoritative name
36:13
server okay so after that you may see uh the number
36:18
of questions uh number of RRS R Us means resource records okay and
36:26
the number of authority authority errors and number of additional hours okay so here uh these four are just the numbers
36:34
okay that's just the numbers and then after that we will see the questions
36:41
okay uh if this is a quarry then the questions will be shown here so the name
36:47
and type fields for query and if this is a response message then the answers will be say uh in the in
36:56
this field okay the response to the records in response to the card will be shown in
37:02
this field and um we also have the records for
37:09
authoritative name servers and there are also some additional information that
37:15
may be helpful for example um you may have the information for the
37:21
authoritative name servers um and other things okay
37:27
all right so let's look at some examples right these um experiments here just for
37:33
fun okay so a very commonly used tool
37:38
4ds query is the NS lookup okay you can try it on your own at home so for
37:45
example here I firstly did let's look up for google.com okay
37:51
and this is what I get this is the response okay and you can see the first part
38:02
This Server and address pay attention This Server and address is not the IP
38:08
address for google.com this is not the answer this just means
38:19
this just means is the local DNA server means which
38:25
local DNS server is providing you the answer okay and then if you look at the answer
38:32
here the non-authoritative answer
38:37
okay you can see the IP address for google.com is 200 this one I don't want to read it
38:44
okay but this is the IP address for google.com okay
38:59
and also you need to pay attention
39:05
this is a non-authoritative answer that means the answer comes from the
39:12
cache from the local DS the answer does not come from the authoritative name
39:19
server of Google okay pay attention to that and after that I did another query
39:24
our csus.edu as you can see it is showing the same
39:31
IP address 251-251 again that is the local DN server that means it's still
39:37
the same server replying to me okay and some of you may ask what is this
39:43
this is the Pearl number 53 is the post number for DDS service
39:50
okay it's like 84 HTTP 25 for email okay and then you can see the answer for
39:58
csus.edu is
40:04
130.86.9.189 this is the IP address for Sac State for for csus.edu okay
40:10
and then I did another query I'm very curious so I call it
40:17
dns.csus.edu I want to know the IP address for DNS of CN csus.edu
40:24
but unfortunately the server cannot find this dns.csus.edu
40:32
that means safety do not have this machine does not have this machine
40:38
then I'm curious if this is not the DNS server then who is the answer
40:46
so then I did a lookup again and this time I type in the type
40:53
equal to NS csus.edu [Music] okay this is two
41:03
get the name server for CSUS EDU so I get two answers
41:09
apparently the name for CSU for the CSUS CDU the answer is not
41:16
ds.csus.edu it's actually s4.csus.edu and as through.csus.edu
41:24
okay um and then I'm again very curious I want to know which one is this machine
41:33
okay is this S4 os3 so I did another NS lookup
41:41
as4.csus.edu and then you can see actually this is an S4
41:49
right it's ns4 and then I did another lookup of S3 and it returns me a
41:56
different IP address so this proves that is actually as for
42:02
providing the local DN service to me and it also shows you that on exact State we
42:09
actually have more than one DN servers okay
42:15
and then I did another lookup okay what I look up is I want last time to
42:23
remember we talked about the smtp.csuf.edu right so this is the mail
42:30
server do you remember mail server adjusted but we want to know
42:37
the canonical name for this one and after that you can see after the lookup you can see I get the canonical
42:45
name which is smtp.statlink.csus.edu okay
42:51
so you can do the same practice at home if you like um
42:56
this is a this is like exploring process very interesting okay so then now you understand how you can do the lookup
43:03
okay any questions
43:10
okay so another thing I want to emphasize is
43:16
about inserting records into DS so why we need to re research records into DS
43:24
you imagine in a scenario for example you are um you have a new company a new startup
43:30
which is called for example Network Utopia okay and you want everybody to
43:36
know about your network right to know about your company then you have to register your company at the DNS
43:44
register okay you basically need to register this name Network utopia.com
43:54
okay so then what you need to do is you need to
44:00
provide two things at least two records okay one thing is that you need to tell
44:08
others what is your DNS server that is very important because DS server the D
44:17
answer reveal provides all the mappings between the host between all host and
44:22
the IP addresses so the answer is like the contact person you need to let
44:28
others know who your contact person is otherwise nobody can contact you right
44:33
nobody can reach reach out to you that's why the very first directory need
44:38
to insert is the network utopia.com and provide the DNS
44:46
the DNS server name and this is type NS Type n s because that is used to provide
44:53
the DNS server's name okay but pay attention this is just providing
45:00
the name but the question is how can others contact him you also need to
45:05
insert another record into the um
45:11
uh TLD server you also need to tell others IP address for the CNN's name server
45:21
okay and then others will know how to contact it so for this record it's type
45:27
A because this is a the name
45:32
the IP this is type A record okay you are providing a mapping between IP and a
45:38
name okay so this will become a test problem
45:44
so in the test I may ask to you if you have a new startup
45:51
okay if you want to let others know your company your your
45:58
um the IP address for all your domain name what would you do what are the two
46:04
records that you will insert into TLD for sure okay at least two records so
46:11
again keep that in your mind first thing is tell others who is your DN server use
46:17
the using the NS type and then tell others the IP address for this DNS
46:23
server using the type a record okay those are the two records you need to
46:29
add of course you you need to also include another type a record for your
46:36
web server right and then you need to also insert
46:41
um MX record for this dummy that means you need to provide a mail server okay
46:48
and with all those four then you are complete Okay so
46:55
but at least you need to insert the DNS and then the IP address for the S okay
47:01
all right so the last thing we want to talk about very quickly today is uh
47:06
about attacking 2DS okay uh so a very
47:12
common type of the attacking is the DDOS attack he does attack basically means
47:17
bombard the root servers with traffic so we if we send you as you can imagine if we send a lot of queries okay and if all
47:25
those colors go to the root server prove DNS that will cause Radiance will be all
47:32
around so this is the DDOS attack okay but in reality in reality is very
47:39
challenging or very hard to attack the rootiness
47:44
can we imagine why because the root yes
47:51
okay in reality is not contacted a lot because the TLD servers as we mentioned
47:58
are already uh already cached in the local DS okay it's like with everyone
48:07
all the local audience already has the content information for the thing they
48:12
don't want to bother the president again because they already know how to contact the thing so what what is the rationale
48:18
to contact the president again so that's why in most cases
48:24
attacking the routine server is actually very difficult but uh doing the details
48:31
to the TLD servers is possible okay it's possible because the TRD server may
48:37
be contacted a lot um so that is uh that is the uh the details
48:43
attack okay and another type of attack is called the redirect attacks okay and uh
48:51
also DNS poisoning so this is a very common type so what is happening is
48:57
actually for example if this is the local DS
49:04
okay and then it will contact
49:09
the original routines or whatever or TLD
49:15
okay for example TLD name servers okay and then some people some money in the
49:23
middle okay will intercept the query so for example the TLD will return some
49:30
IP address right a real IP address but this bad person this bad guy will
49:35
actually intercept the query and provide a fake IP address
49:42
Pride provide a fake IP address to this local DS does this make sense okay give a fake
49:51
IP and this click it will be stored here at the local DS
49:57
okay it's cached there in the local DS then in this case we call this as DNS
50:04
poisoning the reason is because if there's somebody else the client is requesting for local DS contacting local
50:11
dance again uh for uh the IP address for some
50:16
machine okay let's see if this is uh again test.com
50:22
and now test.com has a fake IP and then this fake IP will be returned to client
50:28
if there are some other clients contacting the game for test.com the local DS will say oh I already have
50:35
the IP for test.com so the fake IP is returned again to the to another client
50:41
so that's why it's called pointing because um they are all cached here at the local
50:46
DS okay and yes poisoning can also happen
50:52
um between the other DN servers like between the root and TLD between the TLD
50:58
and the authoritative name so it doesn't need she doesn't necessarily happen between the local and others okay
51:06
so as long as a fake IP address is stored or cached in their server then
51:15
this is called against poisoning okay because then this cancer reveal
51:21
they are pro always provide the wrong IP address or the fake IP address okay
51:28
this is called the redirect attack another type of attack is called employed DNS for DDOS attack so this is
51:35
this one is also very interesting this one means when the client send out a
51:42
query it will use a spoof IP address
51:47
okay and it will send out a lot of queries using a spoof IP address and then as you
51:56
can imagine all those queries will have a response right and then all those
52:02
queries will will come back two
52:08
this IP address to this moved IP address then this both IP address is the target
52:14
IP actually it's the victim because it is receiving so many responses then this
52:20
is like DDOS attack uh in this attack you are pretending to be someone else to make a lot of queries
52:27
to the DNA servers and machine with that IP address will receive a lot of responses and that is the DDOS attack
52:34
Okay so
