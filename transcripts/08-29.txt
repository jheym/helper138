0:03
all right so today uh we are going to start the first lecture
0:09
um introduction to Networks let me firstly discuss the structure of our class the very first chapter is
0:17
going to be um introduction to the networks okay then the second check beginning from the
0:24
second chapter we are going to discuss the uh application layer then transport layer the network layer and then finally
0:31
the link layer okay those are the four main layers we are going to cover in this class each chapter you can imagine
0:37
because we we have uh only these many chapters in this semester so we are
0:43
going to have super long chapters so be prepared for that uh in this chapter what we are going to discuss is
0:50
basically firstly we want to know what is internet and then the second thing we are going to discuss is what is a
0:57
protocol then after that we are going to discuss Network Edge Network call these
1:02
are very important definitions okay um and then we will discuss how to
1:08
measure the network basically what is the uh the performance of the network okay then we will discuss the security
1:16
part of uh Network this is this security part is uh is very basic okay very basic
1:25
um if you want to learn more you should probably take 154 class the networking and network security class to to learn
1:32
more okay and then we will discuss the layers I mentioned we will we will
1:37
discuss several layers in this class then why do we have layers what is the
1:43
functionality for each layer okay so what are the protocols containing this each layer then we will discuss that so
1:50
for history we will just skip that okay all right so then let's start the first
1:55
question what is an internet um if we take a Nas and both view I think
2:03
last time we did the discussion many of you mentioned notes and the links yeah
2:08
those are very important two things or two components that will compose the
2:14
internet okay so when we see knows basically we mean the computers the
2:20
devices right some of you mentioned servers pay attention servers is just
2:25
one type of note okay servers are although the the the same huge usually
2:32
this sounds like huge things right but actually servers are just irregular computers may they may have a more uh
2:40
computer power computation power they may have more storage Etc but they are
2:47
still like a Computing device okay so here we can see uh okay the servers is just a
2:54
type of device but in addition to the servers okay you can see this is one type in addition to the servers we may
3:01
have the PCS we may have a laptop we may have the smartphones we may have the
3:07
tablets and we may even have uh the smart devices okay what which we call as
3:14
we now we have a idea of Internet of Things you hear about iot again and
3:21
again right so what is iot iot is internet of things so here are the
3:26
things may refer to a lot of things okay later I'm going to show you a slide on this
3:33
um so that all those Computing devices as long as they as long as they are able
3:38
they can be connected to the internet then we call them as the nodes okay or
3:45
we calculate them as the hot okay the hots or the N devices okay and the
3:51
systems well these are all the possible names for this uh Computing devices and
3:56
usually these Computing devices are able to run the network applications okay so for example on your computer you may run
4:04
uh uh email okay Outlook so this is
4:10
actually later when we talk about the email service Union you will know this is actually the client program for email
4:17
service okay and then we need to have some kind of
4:23
server program on the email server okay similarly if you you're using a web
4:29
page using uh sorry not available
4:45
[Music]
5:06
okay in addition to that in addition to those Computing devices we also need
5:13
some kind of links or um cables or whatever to connect them
5:19
together okay so those are called communication links
5:25
so the communication links uh so far they can be either white links or
5:32
Wireless links okay so for for example we may have uh fiber we know this is
5:37
super fast and it has a very low error rate okay it's very reliable uh we may
5:44
also have copper um uh corporate cables right so those are
5:53
like uh wide links but we miss we may also have wireless links like radio
5:58
satellite okay those are all the wireless links um and for these links there is a very
6:06
important matter uh that is that that is used uh to show
6:12
the speed of the links so this is called transmission rate and this is this
6:18
transmission rate is later we will learn it is actually very important it will
6:23
um affect something we call a transmission delay okay so sometimes if
6:28
the transmission also has another name which is bandwidth I think you are all you all know the term bandwidth right
6:35
but what is uh what is the bandwidth the formal name is actually the transmission rate
6:41
um and this bandwidth if you have a bigger bandwidth then your your network
6:50
is faster what does this mean faster faster means you have less delays okay why
6:56
does higher transmission rate cause lower delays later uh I will show you I
7:02
will give you a formula for that okay then now we have the links connecting
7:07
the Computing devices that is this sufficient is this enough
7:15
you think about this if we have if we have the
7:23
um links and devices then Avida can we build a network on top of this only
7:32
so now we can imagine for example if we have most of you say no right so we say no in
7:39
the in the chat right we cannot we cannot we may we may
7:44
be able to build a very small network but we want we are not able to build a large area network
7:51
or will not be able to build a internet why you think about this if you only
7:57
have cables and all vehicle links or on the devices then if you have a computer let's say in
8:07
U.S and another computer in Europe then we have another one in Asia okay so now
8:15
if you want to connect these two then you need you need to have third direct links between these authorities three
8:22
computers apparently it's very hard okay first it's hard to use white links if you use
8:29
wireless links then you may you may need to have a very very very very powerful
8:36
um uh transmitter and receiver but usually that is not possible
8:42
okay even when you think about someone someone of you may say oh I can use
8:48
satellite satellite I I'll I'll uh explain this
8:53
later satellite is actually also itself is not able to directly connect to those
9:00
devices okay it needs to firstly connect to this kind of Tower okay and then the tower is
9:07
actually connected to the browser okay so that's why okay that's why this
9:13
these two things are not enough we need a third type of thing which is called
9:18
tacky switches okay package which is means routers and switches okay so this
9:27
kind of thing is use the two forward the package so as
9:32
you can see these devices are all connected to a router or switch
9:39
okay and then in the middle of the network we actually have a bunch of routers a lot of routers okay then we do
9:48
your level do not have direct link between two Computing devices actually those two compute devices when they talk
9:54
to each other they have to go through a lot of routers okay so which we call you
10:00
lyrical as a for example a path Okay so
10:07
um that is uh that is a uh the package which part okay this this packets which
10:13
are like the uh post offices if you think about uh the postal service so
10:19
those packages are like the postal offices at different um areas so they are they are able to
10:26
forward the uh packets or the letters for you okay
10:33
um and as I mentioned again some of you may think about the satellite so the
10:39
satellite okay the satellite in the sky is actually connected to a tower for us your
10:47
computer when you think about it for example some of you may think oh I'm using 4G or LT
10:53
uh when you use this kind of cellular network okay your phone is not connected
11:00
to the satellite directly because your phone is not that powerful enough okay
11:05
it's not that powerful it does not have the power to send signal directly to to
11:12
the uh to the satellite okay as a matter of fact your phone as is actually
11:20
connected to uh some of the towers okay so some of
11:25
the towers here um and then the towers
11:30
actually is connected to the uh satellite okay and then you may think
11:36
how then how could the towers be connected to the internet as you can see here the towers is actually connected to
11:42
a router okay that is how the signals are uh finally uh connected into the
11:51
internet so actually it's through a router all right okay so uh do remember I just
11:58
mentioned the Internet of Things okay so what are the things so we now have a lot of Internet
12:06
uh devices like for example you may have your picture from connect to the
12:11
Internet or you may have uh the refrigerator connected to the internet
12:16
okay so you may you may even have a toaster which is able to do a weather
12:23
forecast so we can have a lot of devices connected into the internet and now
12:30
smart devices are we have more and more varieties okay so maybe
12:36
um and now you can even for example you may for example have a smart clock which
12:41
is able to send some kind of alarm to maybe a coffee maker in the morning and
12:48
say hey a master has a waking up please make a copy for him or her so
12:55
um yeah so all those devices you can see are now kind of connected but of course
13:00
with those devices it connects with each other and you are actually exposing more
13:05
attack surface to the attackers so they are more they have more opportunities to
13:12
happen to your network that's something you need to pay attention to um I remember maybe one or two years ago
13:19
there was a incident actually uh taking advantage of the cameras so those
13:26
cameras actually all they all use the default password okay it's very easy to hack
13:34
into those cameras and then the attackers basically use those cameras to conduct a DDOS attack okay later we'll
13:42
explain more about this kind of uh DDOS attack
13:47
okay so um and that's the uh the the basic the basic components of network uh
13:55
in addition to that okay in addition to that we need something more as we mentioned
14:00
so we have the heart those Hardware right then the device is the links we
14:06
also have the uh the routers and switches like the packet switches okay
14:11
so is that enough no okay why because we
14:17
still need some kind of uh rules or standards for all those devices to
14:23
follow okay if we do not have any rules you can imagine you can imagine if we do
14:28
not have any rules then how could those devices understand each other right those are just the devices those they
14:36
are not human beings okay they can they cannot understand each other so that's why we also need something called
14:42
protocols okay those protocols usually control
14:48
um when to do the sending how can we do the sending those kind of things right how can we do the receiving when to do
14:55
the receiving so it can chose the sending and receiving of messages okay so for example you can see at least the
15:02
protocols here actually uh so this is a combination of
15:08
protocols from different layers okay we may basically for each layer we have
15:15
some protocols for example as a higher layer AS application layer women talk
15:22
about the emails the web services we may for at least for example you may know
15:27
HTTP right you heard about this a lot at least you see this in the URL right it's
15:33
sometimes you see HTTP sometimes you say https okay that's basically means
15:40
um the web service is using HTTP protocol okay of course
15:48
um this protocol adds up as application layer when it comes to lower layer you
15:53
you may have to use TCP protocol and that's transport layer when it comes to the network layer you may use IP
16:01
protocol so later we will learn this is called some this is called for example
16:07
we have HTTP here then we have TCP here we may have IP here okay so this thing is called a
16:16
protocol stack
16:23
okay so this is called a protocol stack and later we are going to spend quite
16:29
some time explaining this protocol stack um but for now you only need to know
16:35
okay we may use a bunch of protocols in the internet to control uh those DIY
16:41
those devices okay um and this Heroes Skype is uh is one uh
16:49
propriet protocol and 80211 is actually for wireless network okay for Wi-Fi
16:57
um and we may also have some internet standards okay so they are usually
17:02
documented in formats such as RFC RFC means request for comments and we may
17:09
also have ietf internet engineering task force for for the standards
17:16
okay then now let's take uh take a service view we just look at the nard
17:21
and nuts and both view which means we are looking at all those components okay now if we change our perspective if we
17:29
look at the service View um then basically the internet is uh is
17:36
the infrastructure that provides the services two applications okay we know the
17:44
internet is run it's uh I mean has a lot of different applications it is for
17:51
example we may have a web application uh email application you may play video
17:57
games right we may do social you may use social networks like Facebook every day
18:02
so then the internet is basically
18:07
providing the infrastructure to support those applications okay so you think
18:14
about this for example um if you are designing a new application
18:20
if one day you say oh I want to design application that can be used for
18:26
um for mobile phone okay um then when you design this application
18:34
you need to of course do the programming for this application to to implement
18:39
some of the functionalities right but when you do the programming for this
18:45
application do you need to consider the routers
18:51
do need to consider how to do the routine do you need to consider how to achieve
18:57
reliable debt transfer so for example if a packet is dropped
19:02
what what should you do you need to consider a vote
19:08
if you think more if you think more you actually you don't need to right thank you James for the response right so you
19:16
don't need to consider those you only need to consider oh I want to realize this functionality I want to have two
19:25
clients talking to each other for example okay um but you don't really need to consider
19:31
about the routers the switches the protocols of them and how to rely how to
19:40
achieve the reliable digital transfer protocol those kind of things so so you only need to focus the real
19:47
functionality for your application okay of course you may for example you
19:53
may call some apis okay you may call some function calls to use some of the
20:00
services provided by the internet for example later when we learned the spoki program assignment you will know
20:05
sometimes you need to call um call some functions to do to use TCP
20:13
sometimes you may use UDP okay and you don't need to know what the what's your
20:19
TCP is what UDP is you don't need to know for now there are just some protocols but what I mean here is uh you
20:27
only need to implement the the functionalities of the application you
20:33
don't need to implement the functionalities of the internet so internet is basically the
20:39
infrastructure that provides the services to support your application
20:44
okay this is like when you use Postal Service okay when you want to for example email
20:51
uh send a letter or gift to a friend you only need to
20:58
um write a letter or prepare a package right and then drop it to the postal
21:04
office or you can even have them to pick up okay but do you need to worry how
21:11
would this package arrive at New York how would they deliver this package you don't really worry about that right so
21:18
uh that is very similar okay so postal service is again also kind of
21:24
infrastructure that provides the services to you okay it's like that
21:30
um yes that's correct it's like the middleman yeah
21:36
um and then what is a protocol okay so we need to look further about
21:41
the protocol so for human being uh basically uh we also have our own
21:47
protocol for example if you uh have a question about something usually you say
21:52
oh you say hi and the other person say Hi and then you say I have a question uh
21:58
can you can you please help me answer that then the other person responds so we have some kind of implicit rules that
22:06
we follow right uh then it's the same thing for the network the network um because they are they are machine
22:12
they are not human so the communication activities have to be defined very
22:18
strictly okay otherwise um they are not able to communicate with
22:25
each other okay so those uh definition those those activities are actually
22:31
defined in the OR defined and manage it in the protocols okay so here you can
22:37
see this is a like a definition for protocol protocols Define the format order of
22:45
messages sent and received among the network entities and actions taken on message receipt transmission and receipt
22:51
okay so this is a very important definition and this may appear on the
22:57
test okay so in the midterm or final exam I may give you a test like this asking
23:04
what is the definition for protocol okay please pay attention to that
23:11
and if you look at this example on the left this is a human protocol the one person
23:18
say hi the other person say hi then uh the the female on the left is that got
23:23
the time and the other person say yes two o'clock okay uh then in networking is similar okay
23:32
it's similar for example here we have a server and a client okay this client may send a TCP
23:40
connection request this connection request is like a handshaking kind of thing okay it's like saying hi hi to
23:48
each other okay so the client personally say can I connect with you then the
23:54
server responds and say yes let's connect so after the connection is established then the client may say can
24:01
I get this as you can see this is actually a web page
24:07
okay this this can be a web page or maybe a file or whatever so this is URL
24:12
so then the server may say yes sure so then this is the file to you
24:17
okay so if this is a web page then this file is a web page
24:23
okay it's a HTML file then this file can be displayed on the
24:30
client as a web page on the client when I see on the client with me I mean the client program which means the Firefox
24:39
okay which means the Chrome those are those um web browsers okay so for now
24:47
you don't need to understand the details like when I say display this on the client program is that we don't need to
24:53
know that I I'll spend quite some time explaining the server
24:58
and client uh the client and server model so now we don't need to know you
25:04
only need to know oh okay there's two machines are actually communicating each with each other okay so uh one is making
25:12
a request the other one is serving uh the the client or the first machine
25:20
the next topic we are going to discuss is the network Edge okay
25:25
so what is Network Edge Network Edge basically includes those things we see
25:30
here the end systems which means n devices the access networks and the links okay
25:38
so in the network Edge in the network Edge
25:44
we are talking about those machines okay those hosts clients or servers okay
25:53
those horse or those devices okay that's the edge and you may ask okay if
26:01
that's the edge then what is the core okay so Network core
26:08
is purely the routers the interconnected routers okay so as you can see here we
26:16
can see this approach
26:22
this part is the code okay you can see you only see routers
26:28
there that is the core or you can think uh you can also view
26:34
for example you can sometimes we also view these ad vouchers they are they are
26:39
in the edge okay so we may say okay this car is the code both are fine okay it's
26:44
not it's not important so both are fine but at least you know okay this part at least you know this
26:51
part is the code okay so there are purely purely ruptures
26:59
nothing else nothing else keep this in mind and then the network Edge includes
27:06
the remaining things like the horse okay so for example here the mobile
27:12
phone is belongs to the edge this computer the PC laptop belongs to the
27:18
edge okay so some of you may think how about the servers
27:23
okay I know in your mind in your mindset probably service is something huge is a
27:29
huge Center kind of thing okay uh and later you will learn actually when we do
27:35
our own programming you will learn server maybe certain way to just steal a
27:41
piece of code okay it's just a piece of code which sits on the machine
27:49
okay then the machine can be a regular machine for example your computer your
27:55
PC can can work as a service it's a absolutely fine okay the server doesn't need to be
28:03
a huge Center okay but of course sometimes the servers do belong to a huge Center
28:10
especially for those huge companies like Google Amazon okay they need to have
28:16
their own servers they may have a center to host the service okay but you may get
28:23
confused you may think oh does the server belong to the Core or the app what do you think
28:30
do you think the servers belong to the ad or the core so that's something you need to pay attention the servers no matter how big
28:38
they are okay no matter if they belong to the data center or not they are they
28:44
still belong to the edge Network Edge why because no matter how huge they are
28:50
they are still Computing devices okay
28:57
they are still like computers okay so that's why they still belong to
29:04
the network Edge and as we said in the network core the network code contains
29:11
only only routers okay only routers nothing else
29:17
yes this question are they are the servers just bigger computers
29:24
as I said the servers are actually just a piece of code okay this piece of code May sit on a
29:33
regular computer like your PC it's okay it's fine your PC can be a server or it
29:39
may sit in a much bigger computer with much powerful memory
29:45
computing power Etc okay oh it belongs to a data center it's
29:51
also fine but anyway it's just a piece of code does this make sense now okay okay good
29:58
um so pay attention and this may be a test problem so in the test I may give
30:03
you for example a true or false question or just a short answer question I may ask you I may say the servers belong to
30:11
the network code you know this is this statement correct actually this is a force okay pay
30:17
attention to that and then in the network Edge we may also have access Networks okay so what is accessible
30:23
networks Access Network means the network that is used to access
30:30
Internet okay so for example here we actually have three types of access
30:36
Networks mobile network
30:41
okay home network or institutional Network
30:48
prayer all belong to access Networks so for example when you are at home you are
30:54
using home network that is Access Network can you for example you can see you are using your home network you connect it
31:00
to this browser and then when you are at the um
31:05
maybe when you are on campus okay when for all when you are you find a job for example you work for a company
31:12
then you may use some um institutional Network
31:17
okay bigger or Enterprise Network okay so those kind of networks are also one
31:24
type of Access Network so your machine is connected to some switches or routers
31:31
and then finally connected to the internet okay or if you are driving uh or if you are
31:38
in the outside okay then you may use mobile network so mobile network in this case
31:45
as I mentioned your machine your device is actually connected to the tower first
31:51
sometimes we call this Tower as base station is connected to the space station and
31:57
then further connected to this router here and then this router is further
32:04
connected to the internet so this is called mobile network and then this is
32:09
also one type of Access Network so then um we have explained this how to connect
32:16
the end devices to a router we can use
32:21
either whole network we call as also as residential Network okay or
32:27
institutional Network or mobile Access Network okay so we can use those uh Network to connect to these ad routers
32:36
so these are all ad routers okay
32:43
this one is also Edgewater and this one is also eye drops so you can see the
32:48
edge router is actually used to connect the access network and the internet
32:55
core okay the internet code um so you need to keep in mind here uh when
33:04
we see Access Network the access network me have different bandwidth okay so
33:10
sometimes depends width is higher than you have faster speed if the bandwidth is lower than you have slower speed okay
33:17
and also um the link may be shared or maybe
33:22
dedicated for now you don't need to know this later we are going to spend quite some time explaining explaining this
33:29
okay all right so then let's talk let's
33:34
continue to discuss a little bit more about the access network let's think about the exact Network
33:39
for the access network uh if we want to build this how would you build this you
33:45
think about this I think last time I'm going to the discussion some of you mentioned this uh
33:52
mentioned this excellent point so since we already have some kind of structure
33:58
there for example we already have telephony Network right so in the in the old days we all have we do not use
34:05
mobile phone actually we every every home uh has a telephone at home right so we
34:11
have the telephone Network then at the very beginning when people firstly design the internet
34:17
um they will think oh okay let's let's directly use the infrastructure from the telephone Network okay that's why as you
34:25
can see um at a home okay at home we may have a
34:31
telephone we may have a computer okay then you think about this
34:38
um the telephone Network the telephone can be connected to the network directly
34:44
but the computer cannot why because it is using a different type of
34:50
signal which cannot be understand by the telephone Network so that's why we need
34:57
some kind of a model in between okay so the functionality of
35:03
modem is actually to convert the signal or the digital signal zeros and ones
35:10
from the computer into the signals that can be understand by the telephone Network so that is the
35:18
function of modem of course it can also do the reverse transform which means when the when the signal comes back
35:26
okay then it can also transfer convert the signals from the telephone Network
35:32
into the detail signal that can be understand by the computer okay so that
35:37
is this one and then you can see there is also splitter the splitter here is to use is used to split the signals into
35:45
two parts Y is going to the telephone the other one is going to computer okay
35:52
and you can see this is a one home and then we may have the other home a lot of
35:58
homes they are actually all connected together uh they are all connected
36:04
finally to some kind of central office in this central office we may have DSL
36:10
access multiplexer okay and then finally this multiplexer is connected to the
36:17
internet to the routers here okay so this is actually the design of
36:24
the very old days um internet it is using the digital
36:32
subscriber line okay which is a part of the the telephone Network okay
36:39
um at that time the speed is actually slow okay it's not very fast because you
36:46
think about this the telephone Network for that the speed is really slow okay
36:52
any special name for the Upstream transmission rate the Upstream which
36:58
means um from home to upload to the internet the speed is usually smaller than 2.5
37:05
Mach BPS so Mega BPS BPS means beat pure
37:11
seconds okay um and then the uh Downstream
37:19
transmission rate which is the downloading speed is usually faster it's smaller than
37:25
um 24 megabits per second okay
37:31
um so Alex is asking is this multiplexer similar to the one in CPU architecture
37:39
um so this multiplexer is uh actually used to
37:45
um thank you actually a sign the packets or signals
37:51
to different home home networks okay and
37:57
later we are going to learn more about this so the multiplexer is like a Friday
38:02
for example at home your parents okay make may receive a lot of letters
38:09
letters from letters for you and for your siblings okay
38:15
um for your browsers sorry brother and sisters Etc and then
38:21
your parents need to say hey Alex this is your letter and then uh maybe another
38:27
and then say to a sister let me say hey this is your letter so basically assign
38:32
the letters to different person that is for multiplexing and later we are going to more learn more about oh this is
38:38
called D multiplexing for example uh and then we also have multiplexing okay
38:44
multiplexing is like collecting the letters from all of you and then send it to the uh the the postal office it's
38:52
like that okay um so here's DSL multiplexer and this
38:59
this is actually like assigning the signal to different uh home networks
39:05
okay is there any server or Edge components
39:12
in the telephony network any server or Edge component this is a great question
39:18
so um so here the edge components we also have the computers they are this
39:23
belong to the edge it's similar so you can see uh these computers no
39:28
matter how it is connected finally it eventually connected to the routers okay
39:34
so here the routers are still the core and then we may we have those computer
39:39
itself belonging to the edge okay growing to the edge and of course
39:45
here when we we are kind of zoomed out and let you see the details for example in the edge you need to you need to have
39:51
some kind of modem okay this is actually built upon the DSL and later we will see
39:57
if it's built upon the cable it's similar things okay
40:02
um and then do we have several of course we have servers okay so for example we
40:07
may have Google's computer here Google server here the web server for Google we
40:15
may have the web server from CSUS server okay of course these are just web
40:22
servers and you may also have email several files server again service a lot of servers okay so they are all
40:28
connected in some way to the browsers okay
40:34
then this is the DSL and after that we uh after some
40:40
development we finally realized that the telephone network is not not fast enough because it's usually it only transfer it
40:48
always only uh yes um transfer the digital sorry the the
40:54
audio signals right so it's not fast enough and then after we had TVs and
41:02
then we know okay the cable network is much more powerful than the telephone Network because in cable network we can
41:09
hold videos videos basically contain both images and also the audios right so
41:17
a video is basically composed of images and audios
41:22
and then we all know the video actually has much bigger capacity right uh I mean
41:30
and then the cable network are much faster than the telephone Network that's why eventually uh we decided to switch
41:38
our infrastructure from DSL to cable but you can think about this even if you
41:45
are using cable still the signal types are different we still need a modem to convert the
41:54
signals from computer into the signals that can be accepted by the cable network
41:59
okay so that's why you in your lane in your home network I guess most of you
42:05
know oh okay we have a router you can probably guess what the router is used for but we also in addition to the round
42:12
trip we also need a modem then what is the modem used for right now you know
42:18
okay the modem is you basically use the for converting the signals and also we
42:23
need a splitter okay the splitter is used to split the signals okay so you
42:28
can see this is an example of the home network and all those home networks are
42:35
connected to a Mainline this main line is actually finally converted to the
42:41
keyboard hadn't um so because here there is actually a problem because there are multiple home
42:48
networks connecting to this main line as you can see here then there is a problem the problem is
42:57
um how can we accommodate the signals from different home networks
43:03
right if they all want to transmit something then how can we allow them to transmit at the
43:10
same time then this this is actually uh what we call as a multiple access problem and
43:17
later we are going to especially in the link layer we are going to dedicate some time to discuss that the protocols for
43:24
multiple access okay for now you uh you only need to know we actually have
43:29
different different methods to split the signals or to split
43:35
the entire uh bandwidth to different home networks okay
43:42
for example here you can see for this cable for this one cable we may have
43:47
multiple Channel nodes okay we may have here you can see we have actually nine
43:53
channels then the first five the first six channels are for the video
43:58
it's for the caliber okay and then we have two signals two channels for the
44:06
data and one channel for the control so um then for each Channel you can see
44:11
both channels one two six even if they are all for the video but
44:18
they still have different frequency right low frequency high frequency so
44:24
for this kind of a um method we call this frequency division multiplexing
44:31
okay that means the different channels transmit the signals in different
44:36
frequency bands okay so then in this way we can tell uh
44:41
the we can we can distinguish the signals from different channels okay
44:47
any questions so far okay
44:53
then um we can use for example we can use for this Main
44:59
Line we can use a High Hybrid fiber coax to do that usually pay attention uh the bandwidth
45:07
the speed is is actually a symmetric for Downstream transmission rate and
45:13
Upstream transmission rate this is actually very very common usually because most of the users are
45:19
downloading okay uploading is usually very I would say we have less
45:24
opportunity to upload usually so that's why the downloading speed is really much
45:30
faster than the uploading speed okay or we can see the downstream transmission rate is much higher than Upstream
45:39
transmission rate okay the transmission rate we know it also has a very well known name it's called bandwidth
45:51
as I mentioned again see how it might process problem okay what if we have multiple users they
45:59
all want to send some signals transmit signal at the same time then they have come some kind of computation to compete
46:06
for for this uh available uh bandwidth here in the main line then
46:12
this is the multi-process network so we will discuss that later that means
46:18
the homes actually share the access network to the cable Head end okay
46:24
all right um if we take a closer look at the home network
46:29
you can see here is to and from the head end of the central office then we here
46:37
we have the cable modem all the DSL modem depending which kind of network
46:42
you are using and then we also have the voucher
46:48
here the router is usually now the router is actually very Advanced
46:53
originally um in the old days the routers are just router they are just responsible for
46:59
routine but gradually routers integrated the functionality of firewall also okay
47:05
you may ask why how can we integrate firewall why can we increase integrate
47:10
the firewind router if you think about firewall firewall is like a filter okay
47:16
it allows the traffic uh allows specific traffic to come in
47:22
and deny some of the traffic okay so we use basically do some rules to Define
47:28
um which traffic can come in which traffic can will be denied so especially if you think about this for example now
47:37
if you want to refuse the traffic from a certain IP address then you can say okay
47:43
if the source IP address is from this this address a for example then all the
47:52
track traffic will be denied that means every time if there is a packet comes in
47:57
then we will check the IP address the source IP address for that package if
48:02
that packet is from a package is from the address we don't like then we just
48:08
deny that package we refuse to pass this to the destination computers
48:14
okay so that's how the file will work the reason we can combine firewall and
48:20
router is because actually all the traffic needs to go through the
48:26
router first and then go to the destination computers that's why we can
48:32
actually filter the traffic here at the router okay and that is another thing
48:37
that is called Network address translation I don't want to spend more time here discussing that we will also
48:46
dedicate some time discuss this but uh just to let you know the router can also
48:51
certify that functionality it's basically trans I would say translate the network address from public address
48:59
to private address or from private address to public address okay
49:04
so those are the solar functions for the router
49:09
and then here we also have this this is these are called the wireless access
49:14
point okay most of the time you will say oh that's how the router look like yes
49:21
that's exactly how the router look like at your home usually actually we combine
49:27
this wireless access point with the router okay these two are combined in
49:33
one single box that means your router your router also has the wireless access
49:39
point that's why you see this device at your home okay and in addition to that you will sometimes if you do not use
49:46
wireless you do not use Wi-Fi you can see this computer is using Wi-Fi okay so for the other computers they are
49:54
connected to the router directly with the cable okay so then that is called
50:02
that is usually called the ethernet The Wider ethernet okay and we may also have
50:08
the wife the phones connecting to the uh what is success point
50:14
so that is about the home network
