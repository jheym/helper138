0:04
just okay uh so far we have talked about the
0:09
channel partitioning Mac protocols first time uh that type we know we learned as
0:15
a ftdma fdma okay second type is the
0:20
random access map protocols we learned slotted Aloha Pure Aloha we also learned
0:27
csma and csma CD okay that is the second type uh the third type is the taking turns
0:35
protocol taking turns is actually um
0:40
is a is a like a combination of Channel partitioning and the random access okay
0:47
the the idea is also very easy for example here we can say we have a master
0:54
node and a number of sleeve nodes okay but masternodes is like the coordinator
0:59
in the in the middle so the masternodes will invite the cliff the slim nodes to
1:05
transmit in turn okay so for example Master will say hey do
1:11
you have data to send then the first node we'll see I have data then it will answer the second one and say if you
1:18
have what data to send okay second one may say no Okay the third one say I have data so it's like that uh so basically
1:26
the master will invite every every uh sleeve node to transmit in turn Okay the
1:34
concern for this kind of Mac protocol is that firstly we have the polling
1:40
overhead okay the polling it it has hot cost okay
1:46
secondly we may have latency okay because every time you need to ask
1:53
um uh you need to you need to ask if the computer has data to send okay uh it
1:59
takes time the third concern is the single point of failure as you can imagine if the master is down then
2:07
basically this Mac protocol will not work okay so nobody can send it out that
2:13
is uh those are the concerns for this uh polling protocol okay
2:22
um the second type of taking turns is called token party token passing
2:28
um the the reason what you talk about passing is that we want to remove this
2:33
uh Master this coordinator okay so in token passing we do not have any
2:39
coordinator uh basically we have a control token that is passed from one
2:45
node to the next node sequentially and then they take turns to send it out for
2:50
example you can see but this one has nothing to send the token is passed to the next one
2:57
and this one has data to send out okay and the next uh then we can
3:03
continue uh if you if you think about this uh actually token cutting also have
3:08
several drawbacks firstly we need to have a token okay token has overhead
3:14
secondly latency problem the same thing okay so every time we need to uh firstly
3:20
use the token to ask and then we can send uh the third thing the third one is the
3:27
single point of failure again but this time it is uh uh not the
3:33
um the single point of failure is not about the masternode it's actually about the token if for some reason the token
3:40
is lost okay then this again this for this entire uh loop on every Network
3:47
nobody can send the data out okay
3:52
so this is a keyboard Access Network this is a real Network okay let's look
3:59
at the structure and see what what will happen so firstly this is the cable hand and
4:07
okay and we have the keyboard modem termination system these are all the
4:14
home networks okay this is one a big a big one uh and for each home network you can see
4:20
we have splitter and the cable model okay we know the cable modem is
4:27
basically used to convert the signals from uh from the audio signals or cable
4:35
signals to the digital signal right to for the conversion and splitter is used
4:40
to to split the different type of signals um and actually for this entire
4:47
structure as you can see we have the multiple access problem okay for the downstream
4:54
for the downstream uh we basically we can say oh okay we have different type
5:00
of signals for example we have Internet frames we have TV channels we have also
5:06
the um maybe control signals Etc okay so all
5:12
those different type of signals can be transmitted at different type of frequencies
5:19
okay different frequencies so this is a like fdma right so this is a like
5:26
Channel partitioning okay and then for the Upstream for the
5:32
Upstream um signals we have competitions because
5:38
many home networks okay some of the home networks they they all want to synapse
5:44
the signal they all want to send the signals to um the cable hand ends okay then they
5:51
have computation um which is what we call as a multi-process problem okay then in this
5:59
case okay in this case we may have different signals transmitted at different
6:06
frequencies in different time slots okay so here we use both of the
6:11
frequency dividend and also uh time difference okay
6:18
um so you can see for Downstream it's easy for Upstream Downstream because we
6:23
are just doing the broadcast channels for Upstream then all the users contend
6:29
for certain Upstream Channel time slots okay so what is a really happening
6:35
actually is that um
6:40
so for um we what we do is we use fdm over
6:48
Upstream Downstream uh frequency channels this for this one we already know right
6:54
and then for um
6:59
and therefore Upstream for Upstream uh
7:04
uh data okay so for Upstream transmission what we do is we actually
7:10
firstly uh you apply okay we apply uh
7:16
and say hey for example this this is home network will say hey I want to send something out okay uh what can I do okay
7:25
then it will send some requests to the keyboard hands okay the cable
7:33
headings will assign some of the slots assign some slots in the downstream map
7:42
frame so basically it will tell this home network say Hey you can use this
7:48
time interval from T1 to T2 okay then later uh this home network can
7:55
use uh the time from T1 to T2 to um uh up to upload data okay to to do
8:04
Upstream transmission so it is like that okay
8:11
and then the request for Upstream slots is actually transmitted
8:18
um using random access okay using random access so you can see in reality the real network is like a
8:26
combination of different methods fdma tdma and we also use the random access
8:33
okay like for Random Access again we have different uh types like it's Aloha
8:40
it's not in Aloha Pure Aloha csma CSM SCD Etc okay
8:46
so basically the general the general idea is the first lay you request you
8:52
make a request for time slots okay so this request is
8:58
made by using random access and then um the time interval will be assigned
9:05
using the downstream channel to this home computer home network and the home network then can upload uh or send up
9:14
Upstream data using the time slot assigned okay so
9:21
that is uh the general idea um and I
9:27
to summarize what we have learned we basically learned these three different types of Mac protocols and I really want
9:34
you to um remember all of this okay and there are features you should understand we
9:40
will definitely um have questions about Mac in the final exam okay
9:48
all right so the next thing we are going to discuss today is the land
9:53
okay uh for land we will firstly look at the MAC address
9:59
okay Mac address we we have learned IP address we know IP address is 32-bit
10:05
right so it is the network layer address for interface for the new card okay uh
10:13
and this is a used for uh basically forwarding and routing
10:19
um and then for each device we know we all we often we mention a MAC address Mac address but do you really know what
10:26
is a MAC address so the functionality for MAC address is
10:33
actually to um get frame locally from one interface to another physically
10:42
connected interface okay so that means Mac address is actually used mainly for
10:49
the local area network okay between the neighbors between the direct Neighbors
10:55
okay and a MAC address is 48 bit okay this is a burn into the neck roll
11:04
um and uh sometimes we can use salt water to set up the MAC address but most of
11:10
the time for most of most of Mac addresses they are just burning them and
11:16
I think um usually we do not change the MAC address okay
11:21
and if you look at the MAC address again as I said it's a 48 bit so then we can
11:27
represent this with the hex decimal here each letter or each number
11:34
represents four bits okay so four B so that means we have for
11:39
this entire Mac address it has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
11:44
eleven twelve we should have twelve letter or uh number has this more
11:51
lateral number okay um and pay attention
11:57
the IPv6 okay the IPv6 the IP address
12:04
is also representing the E hex decimal okay
12:10
but it's much longer it's 128 bits okay so it's much longer than mac
12:16
address sometimes uh students say oh why do I see also accessible in your IP address that
12:25
is because it is using IPv6 okay
12:30
so now let's look at the Lan addresses so basically
12:36
um this is a lamp and you can see each adapter each new card has its own unique
12:43
unique Mac address okay unique language someone you may ask why we already have
12:52
the IP address why do we still need a MAC address okay what is what is the
12:58
reason for having a MAC address so
13:03
um the macro address is like it's a very unique it's Unique to every adapter so
13:12
it can be used to uniquely identify each computer each interface and also it is portable
13:19
you think about this so for example when you take your computer from your
13:24
home network to campus Network the IP address may have changed right
13:31
but the um the MAC address is still the
13:36
same for a computer is still the same it's not changed so you can see this is a MAC address is portable it's just
13:43
similar to um to to a human if we think about human
13:50
society everybody has a social security number right and everybody also has a home
13:56
address when you move from one place to another place your home address can change your
14:02
postal address can change but your social security number is always with
14:07
you it's never changed okay so the MAC address is like the social security
14:12
number and the IP address is like the postal address okay Mac address is
14:17
basically used to uniquely identify a interface
14:25
um you may also ask them how can they ensure the MAC address is unique to
14:31
every device okay um basically the MAC address allocation
14:39
is administrated by IEEE and then the manufacturer needs to buy a
14:47
portion of Mac address space to ensure the uniqueness okay it buys a
14:53
portion of Mac address space and then when it's manufactured uh the new card
15:00
it will assign a unique Mac address to each device okay to each me card
15:06
[Music] um so that is the basically the difference between IP address and Mac address
15:14
then now we may have a problem okay you may have a question
15:21
um so if we already know if we already know the IP address of our computer IP
15:27
address or Y interface how do we know the MAC address for that interface
15:35
the answer is that we can have we can use a protocol called address resolution
15:40
protocol which is a arp okay and this is a very uh commonly used
15:48
protocol very useful protocol and please pay attention to this so
15:54
basically for ARP firstly we have ARP table okay
16:00
um each IP node on the land has a table called ARP table
16:07
and then in this Erp table we will store the mapping between IP address and Mac
16:13
address of course we also give it the TTL TTM means time to leave
16:19
um it's basically means how long will this mating be uh
16:27
effective okay so after TTL then the address mapping will be forgotten
16:34
so typically the TCL is 20 minutes um
16:39
so let's look at how this ARP protocol worked okay
16:44
um I think maybe maybe I start with this example and then
16:50
we come back to explain okay
16:56
um this is another one okay let's come back
17:02
to this so firstly firstly if we let's assume let's assume a wants to send a datagram
17:10
to B and A and B are in the same land this is a very important pay attention
17:17
A and B are in the same length Okay basically means they are not neighbors
17:23
okay and we know when a sends something to B okay
17:30
in addition to the IP address actually at the link layer a link layer does not
17:35
know any IP address link layer means the MAC address to deliver a packet
17:41
okay so that's why if a amount to send something to B A must know B's Mac
17:49
address keep this in mind a must know piece Mac
17:54
address okay but unfortunately this Mac address is
18:00
not ease Erp table yet do you remember we said every note
18:06
has a ARP table right the Erp table has IP address and the MAC address so
18:12
ideally we should have B's IP address and the B is a MAC address
18:20
here okay but here at the very beginning we a do not have this Mac address in its
18:27
own Erp table and what a can do is a can broadcast the ARP query
18:35
to everybody in this line okay to everybody in this land
18:40
containing this IP address it will basically ask say
18:46
hey who has this IP address okay
18:51
then you may ask how can we do the broadcasting actually we mentioned this before I think when we talk about DHCP
18:58
if we want to do the Broadcasting okay the destination Mac address should
19:04
be FF ffff so 12 F's
19:11
okay 12 apps This Is How We Do Broadcasting okay and all the notes all
19:18
the notes on this line will receive this NRP query okay it's like if for example if I'm a I
19:26
do not know B's Mac address I only know B's in IP address then I will shout to
19:32
everybody to all my neighbors asking say hey who has this IP address
19:38
okay then when B receives the RRP packet B will reply to a with its own Mac
19:46
address okay then this um
19:52
um this Frame is sent to A's Mac address directly through unicast because V knows
19:58
is Mac address right then after that a will basically save the
20:06
this IP to MAC address pair in its own ID its own ARP table
20:13
okay um until the information becomes out so
20:18
that that means after that before this expires a can directly send uh the frame
20:25
to B because a now knows B's Mac address okay so that is the general idea of ARP
20:32
if they are if the source and destination are within the same length
20:37
Okay so this uh pay attention ARP protocol is Plug and Play protocol uh
20:43
they do not need any information from the net Network admin okay no need from
20:49
Network enemy um so this is the uh the ARP protocol
20:55
when they are in the same land okay it's very easy just a shout to
21:01
everybody okay um so then the route into another line is a
21:09
little bit more complicated let me see let's move let's finish this try to finish this okay
21:15
if if a and b are not in the same length
21:21
okay if a and b are not in the same line then a cannot shout anymore
21:27
because they need to go through a router here okay so when a sharp a can only shout to
21:34
this length it cannot shelter to the other line it can only shout to its
21:40
neighbor okay then in this case what can we do if a wants to send something for to B
21:48
through a router r okay uh now let's assume a knows B's IP
21:55
address B is the destination and we also assume a knows the IP
22:02
address of the first hop router are a knows IP address or
22:11
How could a nodes know um the IP address of first half grams
22:16
are sorry not this one sorry not this one
22:21
okay let me see hmm
22:27
it's actually this one okay this is uh Earth's IP address at
22:34
the at the left side of that okay and isline so how could a know the IP address of
22:43
first half router are How could a know this IP address
22:48
the answer is actually DHCP
22:54
foreign DHCP we said when a new computer
23:01
a joins a network okay join the network
23:08
it needs to talk to a DHCP server then the DHCP server will return is IP
23:14
address and also some other information the other information are
23:20
info for example the information the IP address about the first half router
23:25
the IP address or the DNS server and the name of the DN server and also the uh
23:32
the the network mask right so this information are sent
23:37
to a by the DHCP server okay that's how that's how a get this IP address
23:45
and third assumption is that we also assume a knows R's Mac address
23:50
How could a know RS Mac address the answer is using arp
23:59
why because we know this adapter is actually within the same length of a right so we
24:08
just learned if they are in the same length a can simply shout it can simply
24:13
ask say hey who has this IP address of one zero
24:20
okay then our out interface will return this Mac address to a that's how a gets
24:27
to know uh arithmetic address so with these three assumptions let's continue
24:35
okay then now a will create I iptogram with IP Source
24:43
a and destination B okay you can see source is 101.101 destination is two to two
24:50
okay then when might comes down comes to the lower layer link layer you can see the
24:57
source address source Mac address is is source Mac
25:03
address the destination address however is not B's Mac address
25:09
because because what because we don't know this Mac address yet we only know
25:16
Earth's Mac address right we know this Mac address
25:21
okay how do we know we assume we already know that right through arp
25:27
so that's why you can see the MAC address here is actually
25:33
ours Mac address pay attention is not a busy Mac address okay now this Frame is
25:39
sent from a to R okay and then
25:45
and then what this art will do is is Reverb it will remove the link layer
25:53
headers okay and then add a new header in this new header The Source address
26:01
the source Mac address is now this Mac address it's also the other
26:08
interface okay uh the Romans the other interfaces so this Mac address is a 1A
26:14
29b okay the destination address this time is uh B is Mac address
26:23
okay because the router this interface is within the same line as B so of
26:31
course um this interface can also shout to this uh uh this line and ask hey who has this
26:39
IP address and I who has this IP address and then B can return its own Mac address okay so anyway this Mac address
26:48
OB can be known by this interface that's why you can see uh the MAC address
26:53
definition is actually big okay the source IP Source address destination
26:59
address are not changed it's the same okay so then now this Frame can be sent
27:05
to be okay and then B can remove the link
27:10
layer headers and pass this to Upper load layer okay so that is the ARP and
27:17
you can see when they are within the same length if the source and definitions are in the within the same
27:22
line then they can simply Shout but if they are not in the same line then they have to change the MAC address
27:29
to the router's MAC address okay to the router's MAC address and
27:36
then the router will do the forwarding for them since the ARP is a very important part I want to quickly review
27:42
this okay so firstly we learned we learned ARP is a red address resolution
27:48
protocol this is basically used to determine the interface's map address
27:54
when we know it's IP address okay um so if the source and the destination
28:01
are in the same land then Erp protocol is very easy it's very straightforward so basically the source will say hey uh
28:09
who has this IP address shouting to everybody we call this as broadcasting right so how do we do the broadcasting
28:16
we use uh the MAC address of ff12x as the MAC address right
28:23
and then uh the the destination who has this IP address will reply with its own
28:29
Mac address and then the source will cache this ip2 Mac address pair in its
28:36
Erp table that is the Erp protocol when we have a and b in the same line the
28:43
problem is what if a and b are in different lands okay when they are in
28:49
different lands we know we cannot shout to each other okay we cannot shout because we have we have to go through a
28:55
browser first so then in this case we have to assume a no B's IP address how
29:02
do we know because this definition of course we know this IP address right and then we also assume not any nodes IP
29:09
address over the first half browser which is uh which is r okay so how do we know that
29:17
so we learned with we can do this through DHCP right because we learned hcp does not only return DCP is a
29:25
protocol that is used to return or assign an IP address to a
29:32
newly joined uh computer right so then we know DHCP does not only return the
29:40
mat the the new IP address for this new computer new camera it also introduced
29:46
this newcomer uh the important roles in this network right so like who
29:54
is the first half launcher what is the IP address or the first Hub browser so what is the DNS server right
30:01
and what is the network mask so those information are also returned by DHCP
30:07
that's how a no a at the IP address our
30:12
first Hub router are okay and you need to pay attention R actually has two
30:17
interfaces in this in this scenario y interface belongs to the same name with
30:23
uh a okay the other interface belongs to the same line with B okay so now we
30:30
assume a node IP address over the first of router are that IP address is the
30:36
interface belonging to Ace line not a business okay pay attention to that and
30:42
we also assume a knows r as a MAC address how do we know more as Mac address that is very straightforward
30:50
because this interface is in the same line as a
30:56
okay so then we can simply do a Erp because they are in the same line Erp is very easy a just a shout to everybody
31:04
and ask hey who has this IP address and then R can reply so
31:10
um those are the three assumptions with those assumptions and then we can see if
31:16
we want to send something okay uh we have IP address uh IP Source IP address
31:23
destination IP address and then for the map for the link layer we need to add
31:28
headers we also need to add the link layer Source address and destination address right so basically the source
31:34
Mac address and the source destination Mac address and very importantly the source Mac
31:41
address is its Mac address but the destination and Mac address is not
31:47
this Mac address is actually our Mac address that is
31:52
something you need to pay attention okay that means firstly we forward this package to our to the neighbor R and
32:01
then R will forward this
32:06
okay R will basically move this from one side to another side
32:12
okay from one interface to another interface and then add a new Mac Source
32:18
address this time the map Source address is replaced with ours
32:23
um the other in Mac address okay this Mac address of
32:29
um of work okay so that is the source address and the destination address
32:34
destination address destination Mac address is this time it can be beats Mac address okay can be
32:42
business Mac address and then this uh can be sent to B and finally B will
32:47
remove those headers nuclear headers and pass this to operate okay so this is the
32:53
entire process and um we will definitely have this kind of
32:58
questions on the final exam so for example I may ask you uh in this
33:03
scenario what is the destination Mac address what is the sales Mac address okay can you can you give the MAC
33:11
address okay like that
