1:31
they're mean the same thing you really okay in the Enterprise Network
1:36
the protocol we use is usually ethernet of course we have some like
1:44
wireless network okay but most of the PCS servers are connected via cables
1:51
okay the my cables the protocol guys version is
1:56
the ethernet okay and in the Enterprise networks usually we firstly we have the
2:02
servers okay the servers are some machines that are
2:10
dedicated to provide some service to the you to the clients to the users okay depending
2:17
on different type of services we call them different servers but again
2:23
as I mentioned the memory C servers the servers are the computers firstly they
2:29
are the computers and also we refer to the server program sometimes you'll be you may even for
2:36
example install you may even install one sorry
2:42
you may install multiple server program on one machine okay so
2:49
here for example
3:10
foreign
3:17
so if your machine your physical machine is powerful enough and if you're if you
3:24
only serve a small group of people small group of users then sometimes don't even
3:30
need multiple physical machines you can install multiple server programs on one
3:37
machine and then use that one machine to service the server that is also possible okay of course you can also for example
3:44
deploy a number of virtual machines in one physical
3:49
um in one physical machine and then each washing machine serves as a server that is also possible so you can see there
3:56
are multiple ways of implementing this so then in the future when you talk
4:02
about servers we think about this they you don't always think that those servers are big machines sitting in a
4:09
large roomy okay uh we may have a rack of servers it's not like that it may be
4:15
just a regular computer okay depending on how many users you are serving
4:20
and then those servers again those servers they may for example you be used
4:26
as mail servers they need to be used as web servers um there are multiple servers in one
4:32
organization usually and then in addition to that of course we need to have some pieces right
4:38
so these are the pieces personal computers um those personal computers are usually
4:44
by used by regular users okay of course we have multiple client programs
4:50
installed on those client programs are corresponding to the server program for example if you have an email server
4:57
okay then you have email clients so so for example on these emotions you may
5:03
have Outlook you may have um Apple Mail okay so that you can check
5:09
emails or you can even use the web browser to check emails okay and then if
5:15
you have web server then on those clients you may have web web clients
5:20
okay web service clients like the Firefox the Chrome they are all kinds programs okay so those are the PCS and
5:29
then we need to connect those machines together okay so if this is a small
5:34
Network then we can directly connect those machines to one voucher so this
5:40
router we call it as a ad router
5:47
the reason we call this as agile Trace because it will be connected to the
5:52
internet directly okay it helps to connect this entire Access Network to
5:59
the internet that's why we call it address if this network is big
6:06
okay sometimes we are not able to connect those machines directly to one router we may connect them to
6:14
the switch first and then never switch to the router okay so this is a very
6:20
very common and later we will learn the difference between switch and the router
6:25
well now we don't need to know okay so this is like a basic structure for Enterprise Network or we call it
6:31
institutional Network um this is a very commonly used in
6:37
companies universities organizations governments okay and then depending on the size of the
6:45
network and the requirements the demands of the network the benefit of these networks may be different we may have 10
6:51
megaps 100 megaps or two even 10 gigabits transmission rates or bandwidth
6:58
okay so that's the structure so then let's
7:03
continue to look at the mobile network or we could add code column sometimes as
7:08
widest extent works so for our wireless access networks we have usually two
7:13
types one type is called the wireless lens Wireless local area networks
7:18
another type is called Wireless ones okay wide area network okay wide area
7:27
Network
7:32
okay this is a one so for lens we are usually uh they are
7:39
the line is basically means local area network
7:51
okay so Wireless lens are usually very small range okay uh it covers a small
7:58
area it's usually within a building for example you can have uh it can cover 100
8:04
feet and though protocol use is usually the Wi-Fi okay
8:10
or we we call it 80 to 11. so the transmission rate is usually very high
8:17
so that's for land and for what for one it's a usually covers much much wider
8:25
area so usually those ones are using the cellular network okay we'll refer to
8:31
those as cellular network and the speed are usually lower than Wi-Fi okay much lower than Wi-Fi
8:39
um and now we have we have 3G 4G LTE okay and even 5G is
8:45
coming so that is the one and again pay attention when we talk
8:51
about with the cellular network okay those devices these devices
8:57
do not connect to satellite in directly okay they have to be connected to a
9:02
tower first and then Tower is connected to the router to foot and then further to the internet okay so they are not
9:10
connected to the satellite directly pay attention to that so with those in your mind now I want to
9:16
talk some talk about something um that's how the host hits and the package
9:23
to the link okay we want to talk more a little bit more about the bandwidth now
9:28
because we in the past in the networks index all the different type of assets access networks we talk about the
9:35
bandwidth right and we said the bandwidth will affect the speed of the network or the speed of
9:41
transmission then how can the benefit affect that okay so
9:46
we want to know so now let's see this is a computer or a
9:52
horse so this computer is trying to send the
9:57
package out okay so now we have two packets packet one and package two okay each
10:04
packet has L Beats lbs okay and we want
10:09
to send each packet out we know the link transmission rate or
10:14
what we call as bandwidth foreign
10:24
then now if we want to send this l b or lbs out into the link
10:34
so it's like we are pushing we are pushing the data
10:40
in this packing one into the cable and if you imagine this cable as a
10:47
if you imagine this cable as a pipe okay and if you imagine the data as water
10:55
then we are trying to push the water into the water pipe okay of course if you have a white water
11:04
pipe then we can push it out much faster right but if you have a very narrow very
11:11
narrow pipe then we can push the data very very slow
11:17
okay then we may take a longer time to push all the water into the water pipe
11:22
so this makes sense to you the width of the pipe reference the benefit so when I see a white uh wider
11:30
pipe I mean a higher bandwidth uh narrower pipe I mean a lower bandwidth
11:37
so now if you think about the time we used to push the data or push the water
11:43
into the water pipe okay it's like the time we used to push
11:49
the data into the link okay so this time we call it as
11:56
transmission delay okay the time is called packet transmission
12:02
delay
12:29
okay the time spent to push the data into the link like like the time spent to pushing the water into the pipe
12:36
now how do we Define this transmission delay the transmission delay is defined by L over r k l divided by R so L is the
12:45
number of bits in this packet and R is the transmission rate or the bandwidth
12:50
okay so all you can see is how many bits we can take per second then if the error
12:58
is bigger then the delay is is smaller that means if we have a wider pipe or if
13:05
we have a higher bandwidth then we spend less time transmitting the data also in
13:11
the data out okay does this make sense foreign
13:21
okay so this is a very important this slide is very important
13:28
this may appear on the test and we are going to spend more time actually discussing all the different
13:34
type of delays and transmission delay is one very important type okay one more
13:40
important type and pay attention this time is simply the transmission delay
13:46
it's simply the time you spent on pushing the data out
13:51
okay it actually happens here between the computer the host and or the
13:56
the link okay um question has a time a question are
14:03
packing the same amount of bits each time that's a great question
14:09
I'll say no okay uh the packets have different amounts of bits actually in
14:15
reality okay depending on different protocols um so each packet may have different
14:22
size and even sometimes if one packet has a work it's very big okay especially
14:28
in ipv4 in the ordering four of Internet Protocol sometimes if one pack is too
14:35
big when it comes to a very narrow Network which uh very very narrow
14:41
let's say very uh come to a link with a small bandwidth and also maybe
14:47
especially this link may only allow small size or package going uh going to
14:54
the road then sometimes we even break this one big pack into smaller parts so
14:59
this is called fragmentation and we will learn that later but as you can see as you can see it's
15:06
like when you drive on the road sometimes the road are very wide they can they allow big trucks going through
15:13
but sometimes the roads are very narrow and they allow only small cards to go
15:19
through so it's like that the the amount of bits are different that's great
15:24
question question and other questions
15:30
okay yeah keep this formula in your mind is very important
15:36
okay so then let's continue to discuss the physical media and this part is not very important it's just like introduce
15:43
you to different types of uh Medias we may use for the network okay so the
15:50
physical media basically will carry the Beats from the transmitter to the
15:55
receiver okay the base will rock it between the transmission receiver
16:01
then the physical link will carry those beats those physical colleagues can even
16:07
can be either guided or unguided usually guided means cables okay we may have for
16:13
example different type of cables copper coax fiber and then for unguided media
16:20
we may have um Wi-Fi okay we may have radio for example okay so basically the signals
16:26
project propagate freely into all directions it's like that okay
16:32
so here on the right side you can see the twisted pair I think here you are probably very familiar with this I I saw
16:39
this a lot especially in the old days now now it's not very not very common
16:45
obviously um but yeah you you see this a lot actually
16:52
um so this is actually this twist pair is made with copper okay and then you
16:58
may also see the coaxial cable okay the classic cable can transmit the signals
17:05
bi-directionally the signals can go two directions um and then you may also see fiber so
17:13
fiber is really really high speed and usually the it has two advantages
17:19
actually one is high speed second one inside has a very low average okay so
17:25
that's why um later we talk we may talk about error correction error detection and error
17:32
correction let me talk about the reliability transfer usually if you are using like Wi-Fi you have to really pay
17:38
attention to the error Direction detection and the correction but if you are using fiber you don't really need to
17:45
pay attention to pay a lot of attention to that because the low the average is
17:51
very low okay um and then for what is networks we have
17:59
radio so the signals are carried uh basically uh in electron magnetic Spectrum okay so
18:07
the signals can go to different directions and also this can be a
18:12
bi-directional that means transmitter consent to receive and receiver can send it to the transmitter and sometimes they
18:20
may sometimes the signal may go two directions and then they may meet in the
18:25
middle so this is for this kind of thing we call this as clearance this is also uh something we need to to address
18:33
actually networking okay uh the I would say the drawbacks of radio is um it may
18:40
be affected by multiple factors like you may have reflection okay you may experience obstruction by
18:48
objects like for example if especially if you're in New York or if San
18:54
Francisco when where you see the high buildings and everywhere then in that
18:59
case the mobile the signals can be uh really bad okay and then you may also
19:04
have interference between signals that's another thing you need to pay attention
19:10
um we also have different uh radio link types as we mentioned before we have microwave micro reactive we didn't
19:17
mentioned but we mentioned in the line right Wi-Fi so we may have white microwave Wi-Fi cellular network and
19:24
even the satellite Network okay so light signals so those are the things
19:30
um about the physical media for this part you don't need to
19:35
remember you don't need to um these are just knowledge for you to
19:41
know like more like the introduction and and in the test I will not asking
19:46
you about the like the fiber coax Etc no
19:51
don't worry about that the next thing we are going to talk about is the network core so now we focus now we're called
19:58
again in your mind when we see core we mean the routers okay pay attention to
20:03
that so let's look at the core
20:12
so the network code is basically a mesh of interconnected routers
20:17
we we the routers we also call them Packy switch okay uh them basically what
20:25
will happen in the network is if we have if we think
20:31
about different layers again I'm talking about layers because we can never go around with layers
20:37
so
20:50
okay so in now working we have multiple layers and now
20:55
application layer you all know right so application we have those applications like emails webs Etc and then eventually
21:03
it will come down to network layer so the routers are actually working on this
21:08
network layer the routers work
21:15
especially on the network layer of course it will also it also has the lower layer like uh link layer and the
21:22
physical layer okay I will see up to network layer okay routers work up to
21:27
networking and then what will happen is in
21:32
networking is if we have a big message okay this message is an application
21:40
layer recorded message and at each later it has a different name okay so usually what we do is we need to break this
21:47
application layer message into smaller pieces
21:55
add different layers okay and then these pieces will finally
22:00
be passed to the network layers then for at the network layer we call
22:05
these pieces as uh the packets okay sometimes we say packages used a lot in
22:12
network but package it's like a general term but a package
22:18
actually if we be very formal package should be used in the network layer okay
22:25
it means the network layer thing and then basically what the router will do is
22:31
the router will carry this packet okay
22:37
carry this packet and pass it so for example if this is the sauce this is the destination then the router will
22:45
carry this package and forward it to the correct router
22:54
okay and you can see we may have different parts here here is called the routing actually okay and later again we are
23:01
going to talk more about this but now you can see this is uh the major functionality of the router okay the two
23:09
functions are one of the function is actually called the routine okay the other section is called forwarding
23:17
forwarding forwarding basically means for example when this package when this router receives a packet and then this
23:25
router needs to decide should I forward it to this router if we have a b
23:33
C and D okay this router a it receives a packet
23:38
it will need to decide should I forward this package to b or to C
23:43
okay so this is called forwarding and routine is more like more big picture
23:49
right routine is like choosing a path like this okay
24:00
but for wording as you can see forwarding is actually like it's local and locally I need to decide which
24:07
interface I should forward to okay question is mentioning using diagram
24:13
great yeah that's great point when we do the routine we need to use it we usually
24:19
need to choose the shortest path right or the least cost part so di construct
24:26
algorithm is actually one very important uh component in the routing although
24:31
this is not the only um algorithm used in your routine but it's a very important one okay and a
24:39
very commonly useful one in routine and we are going to talk more about that in the network layer
24:44
thanks for pointing out thanks for pointing out the question
24:51
any other questions or comments okay then now let's talk about how a
25:00
router worked okay and here again you can see we have a source computer a destination computer
25:07
and you can see the link has a bandwidth of our again rbps VPS I
25:14
mean beats per second okay this one also has rbps okay they may I
25:21
mean the link capacity may be the same or maybe different it doesn't really
25:27
matter okay so here we can have R1 R2 maybe okay but Force us
25:33
um Simplicity here we just assume those two links should have the same bandwidth
25:40
which are okay and now we have three packets
25:45
one two three each packet has L Beats
25:51
okay each pack has all these and they pay attention the router when
25:57
it works if you use a mechanism called store and forward what does this mean
26:03
this means when the routes are forward the package
26:08
it needs to wait for the whole package to arrive okay
26:15
yes this packet is not complete then the router will not send this out
26:20
it will not send an incomplete packet out okay so it will wait until the
26:27
entire package comes in the package is stored in the launcher and then the
26:32
router forward it out so this is called store and forward
26:38
okay and now you can see if you recall what we have just learned
26:48
here do you still remember here when we talk about pushing the data into the link right so it happens at the computer
26:55
side basically this computer needs to spend L
27:02
over R time to push the data into the link this is called the transmission
27:09
delay this is the delay happened at the route at the computer side okay at the
27:15
computer side and now if you look at this scenario
27:24
in this scenario the data first will be put will be pushed from the computer
27:30
let's see if this is a and a b okay it will be pushed from a into the link
27:38
and can you tell me the transmission delay we spent here
27:44
can you tell me how much time do we need to push
27:49
do we need to push one packet into the link
27:54
based on what we have learned before can you tell me the time let's see this is Arrow one this is L2
28:02
from a to L1 we see the time we spend is Lor actually right it's l over
28:10
this panahira is our or okay and then when the packet won when the
28:18
packaging one arrives at the router thus the router need to push it out
28:25
again yes the router need to push it out again
28:31
to link L2 why because here we haven't received we haven't
28:39
arrived at the destination yet right so of course the router need to push it out again can you tell me how much time do we need
28:47
to spend here at the router to push the data out
28:54
or formally we can see how much time what is the transmission delay as the
29:01
router that should be L over right that should be l over r
29:09
again okay of course if these are a different then here for l y if this is
29:15
R1 okay for L2 if this is R2 then I would say l-o-r-2 it depends on
29:22
the link right so then if R1 equal to R2 then in total
29:30
finally I mean the next step is the packet arrived at the destination right so when the packet arrives at the
29:37
destination do we need to push it out again no need right because it already arrived
29:43
at the next destination why do we need to push it again so then in total if you think about this
29:49
entire process how much time do we spend to push the
29:54
data to the link what is the total transmission delay if
29:59
you think about this
30:12
the total transmission delay is actually the time we spend at R1
30:20
sorry the ethnic one and the time we spent at the launcher link two
30:26
so it's lor1 Plus lor2 if if R1 equal to
30:31
R2 then we have 2 L over r okay so in this example if L equal to
30:37
7.5 magnitude Max this and r equal to 1.5 microbps then the one-hub
30:44
transmission is actually 7.5 over 1.5 which is a this is 7.5 over 1.5 which is 5 right
30:54
then at basically that means at at the computer a we need to spend five seconds
30:59
at the router side we need to simplify five seconds so in total the transmission delay is actually 10
31:06
seconds okay and we are going to discuss more about the delay in the future but this is a
31:15
definitely the beginning okay I really hope you pay attention to this and this
31:20
will be on the test
