0:05
the next thing we are going to discuss is uh in Ethernet okay ethernet is the
0:11
dominant wire land technology we are actually still using it right now right
0:17
um so you can see this is this uh this figure is actually the uh sketch for the
0:24
ethernet at the very beginning okay um and um over the time we have developed
0:31
different types of ethernet so firstly we have bus bus type structure okay this
0:36
is very popular so mid 90s and then gradually we learned okay this this will
0:42
have some problems because we may we may easily have the multiple access problem
0:47
we may have the Collision uh happening okay so that's why people
0:52
gradually um switch the bus structure to star kind
0:58
of structure okay the right side is the star structure in this structure we
1:03
always have a switch in the middle okay and then uh each computer or each each interface
1:11
is actually connected directly with the switch okay did not connect with each
1:16
other um so this is the ethernet frame structure
1:22
okay so basically the sending adapter encapses the IP datagram in the ethernet
1:30
frame okay so the iptogram is here in the data it's the payload okay and
1:38
then we have the preamble preamble is um uh is a very special string of uh bits
1:48
okay so the it's basically uh seven bytes
1:54
of this salmon buys a one zero one zero one zero one zero this is one byte right
2:00
so we repeat this for seven times and Then followed by one byte hour one
2:08
zero one zero one zero one one okay so what is this for this is the use of four
2:14
pre-m for for synchronization okay for synchronized between the sender and
2:19
receiver's clock um and then we have the source and
2:24
destination destination Source address okay those addresses are pay attention those are Mac addresses okay not IP
2:32
address because the IP address we know is seeing that IP disk program okay so
2:37
these are the Mac addresses um and we know the MAC address is a 48 bits
2:46
that means uh six byte for each okay and then this field is the type this type
2:54
indicates the higher layer protocol mostly IEP okay uh and then this is the
3:02
CRC CRC we have learned that right psycholic redundance checking uh this is
3:08
a for error detection and error tracking okay
3:17
um so for ethernet we know uh this is a connectionless connection list doesn't
3:23
mean we do not need cables to connect them connection isn't here means at the
3:28
lower layer at link layer we do not need to do any hand shaking to establish a
3:34
connection no handshaking between the sending and receiving new curves okay
3:40
and um this is unreliable because
3:46
um the receiving new card doesn't does not send any sicks or any Keys choose to
3:54
the sending Nick okay the data in drops frames recovered only if the initial
4:00
sender uses a higher layer rdt so you can say
4:05
um we do not have any reliability uh in
4:11
um in the in the ethernet protocol okay no reliability if you want to ensure
4:17
reliability to transfer then you have to re rely on upper layer which are the
4:22
transport layer okay which is the transport layer and then
4:28
um the Mac protocol here Mac is is a means multi-access protocol right
4:34
multiple search protocol is and slotted csma CD with binary back off
4:41
csma means we always listen before we send right and CD means clear detection
4:48
that means when we detect any clearance then we will immediately stop
4:55
um transmitting the packet okay that is Sesame macd and binary back off means
5:01
what means that we will try to resend with a probability okay resend this uh
5:07
this one with the probability of this Frame um so there are many different ethernet
5:14
standards actually depending on different links and different physical
5:20
layer implementations um so you can see uh these are the
5:26
physical layer if the if we are using physically copper physical year then these are the
5:34
protocols and then the red color is for fiber physical layer okay different protocols
5:42
um that's all about the ethernet so the next thing is which
5:48
is a very important device in link layer
5:54
um so basically what it does is it it will store and forward ethernet frames
6:00
is similar to the router which also do a store forwarding IP datagrams right
6:06
um so the switch will examine the incoming frames Mac address and then
6:12
selectively forward the frame to one or more outgoing links okay so this is a
6:21
you keep in mind switch always switch always always work with the neighbors
6:27
the local area networks the the devices can directly connecting to it okay it
6:33
doesn't care about the other devices that are far away it only cares about
6:38
the devices that are directly connected to to it okay
6:45
um and switch is also transparent transparent here means the hosts are
6:51
unaware of the presence of switches they feel like they are communicating with
6:56
each other directly but they are going actually going through the switches okay and switches do not need to be
7:03
configured it is a plug and play it can do self learning so unions which is very
7:09
straightforward now we can look at this uh this example if we have for example here we have ABCD
7:18
uh sorry ABC a prime B Prime C Prime they are all connected to a switch
7:25
okay and this is which we all uh buffer the packets now
7:32
um you can see for example a can send package to a prime and B can send a
7:39
packet to B Prime they can send together okay they can send uh transmit simultaneously there there is no
7:46
clearance okay there's no cleaner don't worry about completing but if we are using the bus kind of structure then we
7:53
will have clearance okay and then you may ask how does the switch
7:59
know that a prime is reachable while this interface 4 and B Prime is
8:06
reachable y interface y how does the switch know that when a switch receives a packet how does the
8:13
space switch know which outgoing link to send so this is a question this is a question
8:20
we asked ourselves when we learn about the routing right the routers we know
8:27
the routers is generating a local forwarding table that local forwarding table is able to
8:33
decide help decide which Auto green link this package should be forwarded to
8:39
right so for switch for switch it also has some kind of forwarding people
8:46
but it's different from router for router we know the local forward table is generated by running a routing
8:53
algorithm right so for switch the local forwarding table the forward table is
8:59
actually generated through self-learning okay so what does this mean
9:05
so the switch also has a as I mentioned it also has a table here
9:10
okay it's very similar to a routine table
9:16
okay but it generally this table through self-learning self-learning basically
9:22
means switch will learn which horse can be reached through which interfaces
9:29
gradually okay um so for example for example let's see
9:35
now a is sending a frame to a prime you can see the source is a a destination is
9:44
a prime okay now it will send this one to the switch
9:51
okay see you can see this packet is actually going through
9:56
this uh interface one right and then switch will learn oh okay
10:02
a is sending a frame through interface one so then a is reachable through
10:10
interface one okay so that is uh that is learned by
10:15
the switch and put into the switch table and the for each record we also have a
10:22
TTL sorry for that and then um after that after that we
10:31
know switch doesn't know how to reach a prime because there is no entry for a prime right so
10:41
now what can we do what we can do is basically you can say
10:47
the switch will broadcast this to everyone
10:52
excluding a okay except a so to everyone and say hey uh I'm going
11:01
to send this to a prime so who has this definition address of a
11:07
prime okay then in this case a prime will
11:12
reply right a prime will see hey that's my Mac address and I'm the one uh that should
11:21
accept this Frame so and then a prime will reply to a in
11:28
this case you can see a the switch learned this again the switch will learn okay a prime is
11:35
sending this through interface 4. okay so then this will be put into the
11:41
switch table so gradually switch we'll learn all of the mappings
11:49
okay and then this time because this Frame is going to a do we need to do
11:55
broadcasting again to everyone we do not right we don't need to because
12:02
now we already have A's interface Mutual interface right we know a can be
12:09
reached through interface one so then in this case we don't need to do any broadcasting then switch can directly
12:16
forward this to a this is called selectively send I'm just one link
12:22
okay um so that is uh that is just the one
12:29
switch in the situation where we have only one switch but if what if we have a
12:34
number of switches connecting together okay in this case
12:39
how can we how can the switch know how how to
12:44
forward the packet okay so for example if a wants to
12:50
forward this to G let's see how does S1 know uh
12:57
how to forward the the the packet so how does S1 know oh I need to forward this
13:03
to S4 and as for that for this to S3 and then s342j how do we know this path
13:11
the answer is actually still self learning okay so let me explain how this would work
13:18
again and we'll see oh I'm sending something to J okay
13:25
so then it's this this Frame will go to S1 S1 will say oh I don't know how to
13:33
reach J so I have to broadcast it to everybody okay now this Frame is
13:39
broadcast to BC and also S4 okay so as for receives this we know BMC won't
13:47
reply right because B and C is not J um and then S4 will say oh I do not know
13:54
how to reach J okay then I have to forward this to everybody so S4 we are
14:01
basically forward this to S2 and also S3 okay all the switches all the neighbors
14:07
and S2 will forward this to everybody
14:12
okay flooded to everybody because at Tuesday I don't know who is the how to reach G okay then we know D E and F
14:20
won't reply after I still received this Esther will
14:25
also forward this to j h and I okay so then in this case J will say oh
14:32
that is my frame okay then G will form a frame from J
14:40
to a and send it back okay so now S3 has learned S3 has
14:48
learned how to reach a through this interface okay so through the interface between S4
14:56
and S3 so as the reveal say oh okay I just need to send it back to S4
15:02
okay the S4 has also learned how to reach a from last communication right
15:09
so S4 will say oh okay if I want to reach a I need to only forward this to
15:15
this interface and as one of course also knows how to retrieve because they have
15:20
learned they have the switch table okay so this is uh this is the self
15:26
learning process and you can see how this um these uh switches learn and in the
15:33
future whenever we have any package going to a or J they oh no all this
15:39
which is we all know how to reach most of the levels at least S1 S1 and S3
15:45
knows how to reach a and j okay of
15:50
course S2 doesn't know but S2 can also forward this package to S4 and S4
15:55
already knows right any questions about this self learning
16:03
okay I hope this process is is from it's a straightforward to you
16:10
okay so I have explained this so I just um skip this slide
16:16
okay so as you can see in a real institutional Network we usually have
16:22
multiple switches connecting to each other you can see we may have
16:28
um one switch here another switch here here we have multiple switches and they are all connected to a much bigger
16:35
switch and then we may have also have those servers connecting to the switch
16:40
and finally all this this switch may be connected to the voucher okay do we have
16:47
multiple routers no we have only one big router to the external network but we
16:54
may have multiple switches so then this will form one local area network
17:01
okay so you may ask what is the difference between the ceviche and router this
17:09
sounds uh familiar right the the this seems to have they seem to have similar
17:15
functionalities um yes they have some similar similarities they both of them are doing
17:22
slow and forwarding okay still on the forwarding the routers will
17:28
um will store the datagrams and forward it the link layer the switch will store
17:34
the frame and forward it um but they are actually I live different layers voucher is a network
17:40
layer device okay it will only examine the network
17:46
layer headers it can only enter the network layer headers the switch is a link layer device okay it examine the
17:53
link layer headers and both of them have the forwarding tables okay the difference is that the
18:01
router will compute this forward table through routing algorithms as we have learned for example link State Amazon
18:07
okay um and it relies on IP address to to
18:14
determine the outgoing link and switch is different switch will generate the
18:20
look of the forwarding table using self learning right flooding and
18:26
self-learning and it's relies on the Mac address to determine the Africa unique
18:32
so you can see the difference so here you can see the switch has only two layers
18:38
physically or unlinklier but network has three layers okay frame uh physically or
18:45
nuclear Network layer the computers we know they all have five layers okay so
18:51
those are the difference um and I want you to know that the
18:57
similarities and differences between routers and switches I may also have test questions here in the final exam
19:05
okay and the next thing I want to discuss is
19:11
the windland okay um so we know now we know how the land
19:19
works right so we have for example a bunch of switches connected together
19:25
to a big switch and then connect it to the router okay so maybe this which this
19:33
switch is connecting all the computer science um computers and this is the electrical
19:39
engineering and this is the computer engineering okay but there is one problem now
19:46
so for example if you consider a computer science user
19:51
most of the office to electrical engineering
19:57
okay so one day one computer is moving physically physically moving
20:05
to a different office to the electron in your office but this user this computer science user
20:11
still wants to be connected to the Cs computer science switch
20:17
because we know the computer science which will do a broadcasting Etc to all
20:25
the computer science computers right so of course we still want this computer to be managed by computer science but
20:32
physically it is already in the double e then in this case what can we do
20:38
so what can we do um so we we all know uh each switch now is
20:46
like a single broadcasting right so all the layer two broadcast traffic like ARP
20:52
DCP Etc uh they must cross the entire line they also have some security and
20:58
privacy issues efficiencies Etc anyway the problem now becomes becomes
21:05
we still want this computer to be managed by computer science but it is
21:10
physically in double e what can we do okay um we make do we need we may need to
21:18
have like a cable a long cable [Music] um to connect this computer back to the
21:25
switch but it's not as very convenient right so then one solution to that is called
21:32
the waterline okay watch your local area network
21:38
okay so basically this this means the switch is supporting the water line
21:45
capabilities can be configured to Define multiple virtual lens over a single
21:52
physical line infrastructure okay so you can say for example here we have one big
21:59
switch this this is one physical switch
22:05
okay this switch is used to connect all the machines
22:12
okay including computer science and electrical engineering machines they are
22:17
all connected to this one single physical switch but we can create
22:25
two different water lines by specifying the pawn numbers so for example we can
22:32
see all right from port number one to eight the blue color one
22:37
okay they belong to One winner
22:43
okay then the the those Point numbers from 9 to 16 the yellow ones they belong
22:50
to another Villa okay so what does this mean this
22:55
basically means all those blue pores they can only connect with each other on
23:02
if they are the same color if they are different colors they cannot directly connect with each other
23:08
okay so that means when we do like broadcasting we can only broadcast to the same color
23:16
from one to eight or from nine to sixteen we cannot broadcast to everybody
23:21
okay so in this way we can virtually separate the devices chin to two
23:30
different waylands okay so it's like we are
23:36
um we have multiple virtual switches okay so it's like although although they are
23:43
connected to the same physical switch but it feels like they are connected to different
23:51
um switches okay it's like that then if one day if one day uh one computer moves
23:59
the office okay so for example
24:05
if this computer okay if this computer originally
24:11
um it was from computer science and now it is it it is moved to electrical
24:18
engineering office and we can still connect this to the big switch
24:23
okay but we can just configure and make this
24:29
color to be the yellow one so then in this case this computer still belongs to
24:35
the computer science wheel and not the electro engineering relay okay so that
24:40
by doing this we can enable the dynamic membership okay that means the post can be
24:47
dynamically assigned among the vlans okay so that means for the yellow color
24:53
when they do broadcasting they can reach to if this is 4 3 and this is four
25:02
then in this case if computer science want to do broadcasting they can reach to not only 9 to 16 but also uh the port
25:10
number three they can also reach this computer okay and then for these two different Slants
25:19
two wheelands we can connect them using a router okay we can connect them using
25:26
a launcher so um that's how we do that and sometimes
25:32
sometimes we may have multiple switches right so one big switch may not work may
25:39
not be sufficient we may have another big switch okay so in this case how can
25:45
we connect these two switches so very easy we just use some because it's trunk
25:51
port to carry the frames between um multiple physical switches okay so
25:58
for example we have connect 16 to 1 and then this is used to carry the frames
26:04
between different switches okay and we can still Define the colors uh in the
26:10
same way okay Define the vlans in the same way uh any questions
26:21
so the the uh we learn frame format is a little bit different
26:27
um so you can see there are some more information added here
26:33
okay by the winner ID field Etc so you don't need to know this this is just for
26:39
reference okay you don't need to know this for the test uh so for link virtualization we do not
26:46
talk about this in this class okay for data center networks you can snore
26:53
this Center is basically we are basically connecting uh a lot of servers
26:58
together a lot of hosts together right so tend to uh 100
27:04
000 hosts and these holes are openly often often closely coupled in close
27:11
proximity okay for example if we are using Amazon or YouTube or Google
27:17
whatever so those costs need to um provide service and also store the
27:24
data okay and then the challenge is we have multiple applications each serving
27:30
massive number of clients how can we manage the uh the workload how can we do
27:38
load balancing avoid like uh overwhelming one host or a number of
27:44
Hearts over the others right um so
27:50
why am I going to do that is using what we have learned uh using the switches
27:56
okay so um for example you can see here we have the broader uh border
28:03
um round structure and we also have the access routers then below that we may
28:08
have some switches okay so these are the tier one switch
28:13
and then we also have a tier 2 switch and the Tor switch to R means the top uh
28:21
on rack how those server
28:28
um wrecks okay so and there are something called load balancer load
28:34
balance are just normal computers okay uh they can run some algorithms those
28:40
load balancers are connected to the tier one switch the functionality for load
28:46
balancer is to receive the external client requests and then direct the
28:52
workload to different costs within the data center and then return the result to the
28:58
external client okay so basically the client cannot see a Data Center and
29:06
clients feel like it is only receiving the result from one server but it's actually from a data center okay
29:14
so you can see here the traffic is coming in it is going through a load
29:19
balancer okay the load balancer May distribute to this load to other machines
29:26
okay to other machines sometimes it may also need to connect to multiple servers
29:31
for example we may have for example if this is a like this is a web server and
29:38
this may be a data speed server okay the website when we need to query
29:43
the database server to get the results and then the result will be returned back to maps around the
29:50
web part so we will reply um to the client so this is the entire
29:55
process and then with the load balancer and the switches Etc we can assign the
30:01
workload to different uh computer different Hots so that we do not overwhelm just one person
30:08
in the one machine sorry okay and there is a rich interconnection among the
30:13
switches and drugs uh this can increase the throughput between the Rocks okay
30:19
and also of course increase the reliability uh through redundancy because we have redundant machines as
30:26
backup if one machine is down and we have other servers to come up and work
30:32
okay five-point assignment is
