0:01
the next thing we are going to discuss today is about the ipv4 addressing we we
0:08
know we all we are very familiar with IP address now right uh we know it's a 32-bit identifier we use it every day we
0:16
usually what we we talk about is this kind of thing right
0:22
223.1.2.0 something okay it's like that um but how why do we
0:29
um why why do we write IP address in this way okay uh how do we come up with this
0:36
kind of format so today we are going to introduce about the rationales the
0:42
principles for IP addressing okay so basically IP address we know is 32 bit
0:49
uh actually this IP address is assigned for each interface
0:55
for each host or launcher interface so what does this mean this means uh we
1:02
know on a host we may have the kneecard right network interface card
1:08
so this Nick card is a interface is the interface to connect to the network on
1:14
the routers we also have some interfaces so for example you can see for this router it has three interfaces so the IP
1:22
address is actually assigned to each interface okay uh sometimes for example
1:29
on your computer you may have the interface for wire Network and also for wireless network for those two different
1:36
networks you may have different IP addresses that is something you need to pay attention
1:42
um traditionally we already say oh my the the IP for my host is is a ABCD but
1:47
that is actually not accurate okay that is not accurate it's actually for the
1:53
host interface for specific host interface so then what is the interface interface
1:59
basically means the connection between the host and the physical link or the
2:05
router and the physical link okay it's the the con the interface used to
2:11
connect to the internet um usually the routers have multiple interfaces which means it has multiple
2:18
IP addresses okay um and the host typically has one or two
2:23
interfaces for as I said you may have wired or Wireless interfaces okay and the IP address is as
2:32
we said is 32 bit so 32 bits means
2:37
in binary it is 32 bits
2:42
okay and then we know it's very hard to remember this 32 bits in binary it's
2:50
very hard to remember then what is a better way to denote the 32 bits
2:56
um IP address so then people decide to divide the 32 bits into
3:04
four segments for each segment is uh H uh this is one byte basically okay so
3:11
then we can convert the binary into decimal so the number will be from 0 to
3:18
255. okay so for each byte the biggest number
3:24
is 255 then we can we can use dots to separate these four segments four parts
3:30
okay so that's why we can say for example the first bytes the first byte is now converted to 2
3:37
23rd and then the second byte is converted to one in decimal and this is
3:44
one in decimal this is one in decimal so that's why we have two 23.1.1.1 okay so uh in the future when
3:53
you see uh IP address in decimal you know you are able to convert it back to
3:59
Binary okay any questions
4:06
all right uh you may also ask how are interfaces actually connected how are
4:12
they connected for example here you may say oh we have uh this interface
4:20
this interface this one this one with the router we have this many interfaces
4:25
here right so how are those interface connected that will be something that we
4:32
will learn uh in the ethernet layer okay in another sorry I should say in the
4:39
link layer okay in the link layer we will talk about the switch we will talk about how to connect the adjacent
4:46
interfaces okay so that is something you don't need to worry about now
4:54
uh another Concept in networking a very important concept is subnet you heard
5:01
about this term again again okay so what is a subnetic basically
5:08
um for uh subnet we basically mean the device interfaces can be connected with
5:15
each other without intervening the router okay without intervening the router for
5:23
example here we have this these four interfaces these four interfaces can be
5:29
connected together without a router in between okay similarly for this interface you
5:36
can see they can be connected together without a router imbition so now we call this as a
5:45
subnet and this
5:51
as a subnet and this is another subnet okay so we have three
5:58
subnets now and at your home you may have your home network okay your home
6:04
network um is itself is of course a small Network right so you can also view that
6:10
as a small subnet because your devices can be connected together okay but this
6:19
your home network is is a little bit different from the subnets because uh
6:25
you may or may not use a switch to connect those interface scalar your
6:31
device is maybe connected to the browser directly okay so that is the difference
6:36
uh and some of you may ask them how can we know how can we denote how can we see
6:42
usually how can we see it belongs to a subnet or not those interfaces belong to one subnet or not okay so usually you
6:50
can tell from the IP address for example for the IP address usually we have two parts
6:55
the sub Network part and the hotspot so the sub Network part is used to denote
7:01
the subnet and the host part is used to denote the host the individual horse it's like the subnet part is like the
7:10
family name for us we all have our our own names for example my first name is
7:15
showian last name is San right so that the sun is like the same approach this
7:21
means um I belong to the same family okay and then my first name is the host parties
7:28
it's like the hospital it's used to uh denote myself okay to represent this
7:36
me okay this individual so that is the difference then usually if the sub
7:42
Network part the high order beats are the same then very likely they belong to
7:48
the uh same subnet so for example here you can say for this subnet okay the high order bits
7:56
are 223.1.1
8:01
then you can see the remaining this one two three four they are different okay
8:09
so then you can see they belong to the same subnet okay similarly for this one
8:15
for this one you can see the high order bits are 223.1.2 okay the host part is one two
8:26
nine okay so that means they are they very likely they belong to the same
8:31
subnet and similarly here you can say 223.1.3
8:36
okay to the third and then we have 2 27 one as the hotspot okay
8:44
um by looking at IP address you can you can
8:49
um estimate if they are in the same subnet but this
8:55
may not be accurate okay because sometimes you cannot determine
9:01
how many bits are used for the sub Network part okay so that's why usually the best way to do
9:08
it is to look at the topology of this network and see if the router is in is
9:16
is within the subnet or not okay if there is a router in between that means
9:22
this is not a subnet okay and now you can see
9:28
um this is the example we've explained and how do we denote a subnet okay we
9:33
can denote a subnet use some using something called mask okay for example
9:39
if we use the first 24 bits the first 24 bits
9:45
as the subnet part for the IP address then we what we
9:50
can do is write in this way
9:56
223.1.3.024 slash 24 means this is the subnet mask
10:02
okay that means we use the first 24 bits to use as the sub Network part it's like
10:10
I use the first 24 bits as the family name okay as the family name and then
10:16
the remaining eight bits are used to denote the individual house okay so that
10:22
is how we use the subnets now let's look at this example in this
10:30
example can you tell can you tell how many subnets we have think about the informal definition I
10:37
mentioned before I said for to divide the subnet we need to make
10:42
sure there is no rubber in kitchen okay
10:47
so for those of you who see third I'm guessing you are talking about this one
10:54
this one and this one right we are talking about the
11:00
interfaces so those interfaces are connected together without a router so
11:06
they can be three subnets but how about these ones
11:13
is this also interface yes is this also interface yes okay so are they connected
11:20
together yes is there a voucher in between no so this is also a subnet okay
11:27
similarly this is also a subnet and this is also a subnet
11:32
you may say there are no computers but we didn't mention we must have computers
11:37
in between right we just mentioned the interfaces okay the interfaces are
11:44
connected together without a router so that's why those three are also the
11:49
subnets so the correct answer is actually six so the next the next thing let's discuss
11:55
the IP address in depth okay so the IP addressing we have uh we have a
12:03
classless kind of Ip addressing okay so class list um the phone name is called Cider
12:09
classless enter the main routing okay
12:15
um so basically this means for the entire IP address we divide it into the
12:21
format of this a dot b dot C dot d slash X so we divide it into the subnet part
12:28
and also the host part okay so the subnet parts we can use the number X to
12:35
denote how many bits is used for subnets so for example here we use 23 bits 23
12:42
bits the first 23 You Can Count okay the first 23 bits are used as subnet and the
12:49
remaining nine bits are used for host okay and we do not have any requirements
12:55
on how many bits can be used for summer you can use two bits for subnet and use all
13:02
the remaining 30 pieces for host or you can use um 30 bits as a subnet and use only two
13:09
bits as a host so then what is the difference you can you can think about this for example
13:15
if we use a 30 23 bits as the sub Network part okay
13:22
then how many subnets can we have in total for the entire internet if we all divide it in this way then the total
13:30
number of thumbnails we can have is actually 2 to 23. we have we can have
13:35
this many subnet okay sub Networks but in each sub-network how many hosts
13:43
can we have we know in each subnetwork the number of
13:49
hosts is actually two two nine okay
13:54
then you can think about this if we use the first 30 bits and subnet okay then
14:01
the number uh subnet this is the number of a host
14:09
okay if we use 30 bits for subnet then
14:14
the number of subnets is a 2 to 30 and the number of hosts is two two
14:21
okay so that means what that means we can have so many subnets but each subnet is very
14:29
very small each subnet can only have four hosts one two three four they can
14:34
have only four hosts okay if we use for example two bits as the
14:40
subnets let me use three maybe have three piece as the Summoners okay
14:46
uh then the number of subnets will be two to three
14:51
that means we can have at most eight subnets but how many hosts can be accommodate in
14:57
each subnet each subnet we can have two two
15:04
nine we can have a 2 to 29 uh horse what
15:09
does this mean this means we can have only eight subnets but those a subnets
15:15
are huge okay because each one can accommodate a lot of horse
15:22
okay in the first situation when we have 30 bits as the sub Network part
15:28
we can have a lot of subnets but the each subnet is very small it can
15:36
accommodate only four costs okay so then you can see
15:42
by adjusting the number of subnets in IP address we can actually adjust the
15:52
size of the subnet and also the total number of subnets we can accommodate
15:57
okay so then this is very good because sometimes we need a big subnet okay if
16:04
we have a lot of machines to connect we need to speak subnet okay uh then in this case we can say we need
16:10
to assign more beats to The Host okay and the last piece to the subnet but
16:17
sometimes we may have only two machines through machine or a few machine to connect then in this case we can
16:24
um assign as few bits to the host okay and
16:29
uh more beats to the subnet okay so basically we can adjust the size uh very
16:36
flexibly um by using by adjusting the piece of the pc47s so
16:44
then if you do not have any questions let's look at the network classes we
16:50
said we just talked about uh the classless entered the miracle right this is classless but originally I mean the
16:59
network actually was classified into different classes okay for example
17:05
um here with me this here you can see this is Class A for class in a network
17:11
you can see the the white part are used for subnet the yellow beads are used for
17:18
the horse Okay so for class a network you can see the we use the cell eight
17:25
bits eight bits of four subnet and we use the the remaining 24 bits for the
17:31
host so that means what that means and also you need to pay attention for class A the first bit is zero
17:39
because uh b c d and e the first speed are all one okay I O one so that's why
17:46
uh the for class A the first bit is fixed okay it's fixed so then now you
17:53
can say for class a network how many Class A networks can we have
17:59
how many Class A networks can we have in total for the entire network
18:07
you you can check how many bits can we have we have well in total we have eight bits but the first bit we cannot change
18:14
right the first bit is zero so that's why in total is actually two to seven
18:20
right it's two to seven very close to uh yeah two to seven okay
18:28
um and then for the host part for the Post part how many hosts can we have in
18:33
each class a network you think about this we use 24 bits okay so it should be
18:43
2 to 24. we have two to twenty four hosts we can accommodate this many Hots
18:49
in class a network okay so this is for class A for class B
18:55
okay for class B we use similarly we use the first twin uh first
19:02
um 16 bits as the network part but the first two
19:08
bits are fixed okay it must be one zero so you can see this is actually we can
19:14
have two two fourteen subnets each subnet is again two two
19:24
16. okay 2 to 16 house we can have this many holes but in reality okay the
19:31
number of holes should be 2 to 18 minus two why because the host ID
19:38
0.0.0.0 and the ID 225.225
19:43
um is actually reserved for something else okay it's reserved for something else later we will talk about that for
19:50
example uh 225.25 is used for broadcasting okay so
19:56
um so for those for those we do not use them that's why the number of holes should be -2 okay then we can continue
20:03
for Class C for Class C this is basically for example first third piece
20:09
are fixed so then two to twenty four minus 3 is actually 21 it's for subnet
20:17
and two two eight is for house okay and then you can continue for class
20:24
D and E Etc so as you can see um regionally when people talk about
20:30
class A B C D E the major difference is actually their size okay when we say oh
20:35
this is the class a network that is that actually means this it doesn't work it's
20:41
very very big okay this subnet is very big if we see this is a Class B Network okay it's it's like oh okay the size is
20:49
it can accommodate at most about 65 000 Parts okay if it's a cluster Network we
20:57
know this is a small uh small Network okay so it's like that and pay attention pay attention uh for
21:05
this type of classification okay it may not work very well sometimes because for
21:12
example for classy Network we can accommodate 254 of 254 house
21:18
but for class B we can accommodate 65 000 more than 65 000 house
21:23
now what if we have a Network that has uh 1000 hosts should we make it classy
21:31
apparently not because Class C is not big enough should we make it Class B we can but we
21:39
can see there is a risk of IP address right so we use only a thousand IP addresses among this
21:46
entire um Network okay and the remaining IP addresses are listed so that's why this
21:54
kind of classification classification is actually not very good uh that's why we
21:59
prefer to have uh Sader now okay classless addressing okay
22:06
the next the next thing you may you may ask is how can we get one IP address how
22:12
can can host get the IP address okay there are two different ways one way is
22:18
you can actually uh hard code IP address in a file for example you for Windows
22:24
system you can go to appropriate files okay you can change the IP address for this machine or in Unix system or Linux
22:32
system you can also uh set up the IP address manually okay
22:38
basically when you for example in Windows system when you try to set up the IP address you also need to
22:44
specify the network mask the Gateway router Etc you need to specify a lot of
22:51
information okay and that method is not very flexible not very convenient the
22:58
reason is because when you assign IP address that IP address is occupied okay
23:04
but sometimes you don't not know which IP address is occupied you have to try
23:10
different IP addresses otherwise you may have conflict with other machines okay so I've done that before
23:18
many many years ago and I often write that problem that I am competing with
23:25
other machines for one IP address okay so that's why gradually now people are
23:31
using deep CP so DHCP is dynamic host configuration protocol this is one
23:38
protocol that can dynamically assign IP address to the servers or to the
23:44
machines sorry not to the servers from a server to the machines okay so basically
23:50
a DHCP server um wheel respond
23:56
and help to assign IP address to a machine okay this is a plug and play
24:03
protocol it's very easy to use very convenient there is no problem of conflicting IP address let's look at
24:11
this protocol so basically the goal for this protocol
24:17
is to allow the host to dynamically obtain the IP address from a server when
24:24
it joins the network and if and this IP address can be renewed
24:32
okay what does this mean this means because for example when you join a network you are assigned IP address and
24:39
this IP address can be valid for certain amount of time after this time expires then this IP
24:47
address cannot be used anymore but we in this case we can renew the list okay we
24:52
can renew the list on the address in use this also uh this DCP will also allow
24:59
allow the ReUse our address what does this mean this means if one machine left
25:05
the IP used by that machine can be reused by some other machines okay so
25:12
then this also supports the most buy users who want to join the network so
25:17
it's very convenient okay um basically this dtcp has uh the
25:24
digital discover offer request AC key Visa four different types of messages
25:29
let's look at an example here in this scenario we have one
25:35
digicip server okay and we have the subnet okay you can
25:41
see this subnet the first four 24 bits are used for to denote the subnets
25:47
and now we have a new client trying to join this network this new
25:54
client needs a IP address okay so what what what can the uh so
26:02
what will happen after that so basically the client will need to shout to
26:08
everybody okay say is there a d2cp server out
26:13
there why is this a broadcast message because the client does not know
26:21
who is the d2cp server okay so that's why the client has to shout to everybody
26:27
so how can the client Shout very easy okay the source address is
26:35
zero zero zero zero that's why we said before zero zero zero zero is actually reserved okay it's reserved this stock
26:42
address basically means I do not have an IP address yet okay I'm waiting for assigning IP address
26:49
and then the destination address is 255 255 255 255. this means this means
26:58
this message is for everyone for everyone okay
27:03
and here the source part is 68 and the destination Port is 67 that means the
27:10
d2cp server is actually listening to 67. and this is this uh uh Yi address is
27:20
actually this will be changed later okay this means I'm waiting for uh for uh
27:26
assignment okay uh and then last line is
27:31
the transaction ID Okay so then the everybody will receive this
27:36
message everybody will receive this message but for those machines who are not dtcp
27:44
servers they will simply discard the message they may not listen to 67 okay
27:49
they do not listen to 67. only DHCP server is listening to 67 and DHCP
27:55
server will respond to say hey I'm the DHCP server and here is an IP address
28:01
you can use okay how is this now basically the DHCP server now will
28:09
introduce itself my source address is this one and my port number is 67. the
28:15
destination address is now in your broadcasting it's still 255 a bunch of
28:21
255 why because the client does not have any IP address yet
28:27
the division server cannot reply to a specific IP address so that's why it also has two broadcast and the port
28:36
number is 68 because originally we learned the phone number
28:41
168 okay and this is the offered IP address okay so the DSP server say you
28:50
can use this IP address of 223.1.2.4 as your new IP address
28:55
the transaction ID is 654 the same as the last one means this
29:01
is the reply to last message and the lifetime is 3600 seconds what
29:06
does this mean this means the IP address is valid within 3 600 seconds
29:13
after that if you still want to use this IP address you need to renew okay
29:18
and then this client will reply say okay I'll take that IP address
29:24
okay and then in this case you can see
29:29
of the source is zero zero zero because there is no confirmation yet so and then
29:34
destination is still the same thing 255 to 55 okay broadcasting to everyone
29:40
and the IP address this one okay this is a confirmation
29:48
to the server say I'm I will take this IP address okay the transaction ID is uh 655 this
29:58
is like a request a request would say hey I'll take this IP address I'll take
30:04
this IP address okay and I know the lifetime is 3600 seconds
30:09
okay then the server will confirm again so okay
30:15
now you've got that IP address okay so now you have uh you can see the source
30:22
is this one and destination is still broadcasting and now it's a confirmation that this IP
30:28
address can be used by the client and then transaction ID is the same as the last request message lifetime is 36 100
30:36
seconds okay so this is the entire process you may feel like oh the second part seems
30:44
like very redundant right the second time seems redundant uh
30:51
why do we need to have a confirmation again again okay there is the reason here
30:57
because in the network we may have multiple thcp servers okay when the
31:04
client broadcast the message to everyone multiple industry scissors May reply
31:11
with multiple IP address candidates okay so then this client needs to choose
31:17
one specific address and then make the DHCP request say I'll take that one not the others
31:25
okay although I got several offers but I only choose one okay and then the server
31:30
will uh ack so that is the entire process okay and that's the reason why
31:36
we have the confirmations again in the second part this will happen once you
31:42
join a new network okay and sometimes the d2cp server is actually combined
31:47
together with a router the router can directly it also serves as a server okay
31:52
but sometimes dtcp server is separate so so when you connect to a network this
31:57
happens automatically the ddcp actually return information
32:04
a lot of information not just the IP address not just the one we see here you
32:09
can see the IP address of two two three one two uh four right uh actually it
32:16
also provides more information what information this information it will also provide the address or the
32:24
first hope launcher for the client so because we know when the client joins
32:30
this network the client is new right the client is new to this network the client
32:35
has no information about the network so that's why DHCP is very important to
32:41
introduce the basic information about that Network to the client so the clients know how to continue okay the
32:49
first very important thing is the first hop launcher why because when the client
32:54
wants to send something outside the network it needs to contact the first
32:59
Hub browser so that's why dtcp need to introduce the first Hub browser to the
33:04
client okay so this is the first piece very important and we are we actually we are going to
33:10
use this information again again um the second piece of information is
33:15
the name and IP address or DS server DNS server is also very important we
33:22
know the SD has a help help the client to interpret the
33:30
um the mean name address into some IP address okay so that's why it's also
33:36
very important without DNS the client can do nothing okay that's the second piece of
33:41
information the third piece of information is the network mask okay padding in the network Market will
33:50
help the client know which part is used
33:55
for the network which part is used for host so when it is connecting with some
34:01
machine okay some IP address it knows how to interpret this IP address okay so
34:07
that those are the three pieces of information that will be returned in
34:12
addition to IP address by the DHCP okay so this is very important
34:19
so you can say here we have a router with DCP server built into the router
34:26
okay so the the DHCP server is combined with the router
34:31
and we have a switch here and we have a computer here okay we have this computer
34:38
when this computer joins the network okay this client you can see we are
34:43
looking at the five layer now a five layer application layer transport layer
34:50
Network layer okay link layer and physical layer so I hope you have this
34:57
five layers in your mind forever okay do not forgot that and then now add the application layer
35:05
you can see we will form a DHCP request message okay for my DCP request message
35:12
and this message will be sent to the
35:19
um transportator and the transport layer will add a transported layer header here
35:27
okay the pay attention here the transport layer protocol we are using is
35:34
UDP not TCP why do we use
35:40
UDP instead of using TCP we're doing is it is about reliability
35:47
actually no this is not about reliability okay we all know that for
35:54
TCP protocol we need to establish a connection before we do that Exchange but pay
36:01
attention this machine does not know who is the server yet
36:06
okay and this machine has no IP address yet so in this case how can we make a connection we cannot so we cannot make a
36:14
connection that's why we must we must use UDP we cannot use TCP at transport
36:20
layer okay so now when this machine comes down to when this message comes
36:25
down to network layer and then we are adding a network clear header
36:32
okay and then it got comes on to link layer we are adding a link layer header
36:37
okay so this is the entire process and finally this message becomes zeros and
36:43
ones okay the link later we call it a frame okay transport layer record is a segment Network layer recorded datagram
36:49
and then link later we have the frame translated into zeros and a ones then it
36:55
is sent out okay okay and pay attention when this Frame is
37:02
sent out the frame is broadcasted to everybody how do we do the broadcast we know for
37:09
at the IP the IP address we know it should be 255 255 255 25 but when this
37:16
is implemented in reality at the link layer what we will do is we will make the MAC
37:24
address a bunch of apps okay 12 F's okay 12 apps
37:30
in total 48 bits online okay and I know
37:35
you have no idea about Mac address now but it's fine we will learn later okay
37:40
for now you just need to know a bunch of s okay this is how we do the broadcasting at the link layer
37:47
okay and then this message will be received by the dtcp server d2cb0 will
37:54
remove the headers layer by layer and finally deliver this DHCP message to the
38:02
application layer okay and then the DTC server will basically formulate a DCP
38:09
act response continuing all this information okay four pieces information
38:15
client address the IP address of 4-hub launcher the name and address of the
38:20
server and also the network mask actually okay so basic information will be or included and then send back
38:29
to the client okay then when the client receives it the client will remove the header layer
38:37
by layer and finally wrote the message to the application layer so this is a the entire process now the client knows
38:44
is IP address name and IP address of DNS server IP address always first hop
38:50
browser okay so this is a sample message you can see this is the left part is a
38:55
request message and it is requesting for subnet
39:01
the mean name the router's information that is the first gateway router and
39:08
first of all brownstra and also the domain name servers okay so then in the
39:14
reply you can see it is providing it is actually providing the client IP
39:20
address okay and it also provides the sub
39:26
Network mask information DNS servers information and the domain name okay so those
39:32
information are provided in the reply message okay so another question you may ask
39:40
further is okay I know the router or the dfcp
39:45
server can help assign IP address to a host but the question is how could a
39:52
network get the subnet part of the IP address that means okay you can assign
39:58
IP address but how do you know which IP addresses you can assign okay how does
40:03
the DHCP server know which IP address is to assign okay uh so the answer to this
40:11
question is that usually uh we need uh for a subnet it needs to get allocated
40:18
portion um from its price provider isp's address
40:25
space okay so basically for example this is the isps
40:31
um space okay outer space so basically this is one block okay it means the
40:38
first 20 bytes if you look at the network mask is 20 that means the first 20 bits are used for subnet and then the
40:46
remaining bits can be used for horse okay and then this is for the entire ISP
40:54
but if we have different organizations okay the ISP may decide to assign the IP
41:01
address range to different organizations so they may say okay
41:06
let me use this if we have eight organizations let me use these three
41:11
bits these three bits to distinguish those
41:18
eight organizations so you can see organization zero is zero zero zero and
41:23
this is zero zero one this is zero one zero and we continue until we have one one one okay so you can say for all
41:31
these uh organizations there first 20 fees are the same
41:38
but following those first 20 bits we have three more bits distinguishing those on organizations okay now we can
41:46
say okay for each organization the first 23 bits are used for subnet and then the
41:53
remaining nine piece are used for horse
41:59
okay and then of course the dtcp server for organization zero we all know okay
42:05
when I assign IP address I can assign the IP address 13 with this okay and the
42:13
first 20 therapies are for the subnet then remaining these are for the host
42:18
okay so this is how we can get um a portion of the address space okay
42:27
and these are kind of a hierarchical addressing is very useful actually
42:33
um because we know uh later we will learn in network layer in when we talk
42:38
about the routines and we will learn um the Network each sub-network needs to
42:46
advertise to others um which IP address is belong to this
42:52
network so for example um the California California's postal office
42:57
California's post office will need to advertise to the to the outside of
43:03
California say hey if you have any emails going to
43:08
um California then you can send it to me okay so that is uh AdWords advertisement
43:15
okay AdWords advertisement is very important and then
43:21
um you can say when we send advertisement okay we can aggregate those
43:30
um those organizations uh all those those routes those routine information for
43:37
example uh Sacramento County May Sacramento may say hey if you have any
43:42
mail sending to me send it to Sacramento Sacramento you can send it to me and uh
43:48
Los Angeles May say hey if you have any lectures going to Los Angeles you can send it to me so they are all doing
43:54
advertisements and then when it comes to California California May aggregate all
44:00
these advertisements combine them together and only see hey if you have
44:06
any letters going to California you can send it to me okay so it's like that it's like it's
44:12
the aggregation of those adversements so we can do the same thing in the internet as you can see for organization zero
44:20
okay he said hey um this this address space belongs to zero so
44:28
this belong to one this belongs to two this belong to seven and then when they are advertising to
44:36
the internet then this ISP can simply say hey if you have anything with address beginning
44:43
with this pay attention this is 20. okay with this
44:48
you can send it to me okay so why this is 20 because as you
44:54
can see here 20 means this entire ISP block
45:00
okay so 23rd is actually indicating each smaller each smaller organization so we
45:07
are doing algorithm we do not need to say one two three four until this eight okay we don't don't
45:14
need to say these eight organizations we can combine them together and only advertise this okay it's like you don't
45:21
need to advertise sacramental La San Francisco you can directly advertise
45:27
California it's like that okay and for different organizations or
45:32
different ISP they can see okay if you have anything with address beginning
45:38
um 1993100 16 and centimeters okay so we
45:43
select that and this is also very helpful for
45:49
relocating okay or relocation what does this mean so sometimes for example one
45:55
organization may decide to move from one ISP to another ISP we know it's very
46:03
common to change the ISP right so in this case in this case
46:10
do we need to change the IP address for this entire organization
46:15
okay for example now you can say organization one
46:21
okay organization one um change from this Flight By Night ISP
46:28
to ISP or us okay in this case we may not want to change
46:35
the IP address we may not want to change the IP address
46:40
for organization one okay because it's a lot of work we know especially if this organization is a big
46:48
organization okay the IP address may already be known by by the public okay
46:53
we don't want to change those then in this case if we directly move this
46:59
organization to another ISP without changing IP address some of you may
47:05
worry oh in this case this may create a problem when we do the routing
47:12
okay because this already said this already said send me anything with
47:18
addresses beginning with this okay it's like saying send me anything
47:23
beginning with California okay but what if a Sacramento decided to
47:28
move outside okay so what we can do now is
47:35
in addition in the new ISP in addition to the original address range we can add
47:41
something more we can just say okay if you if you have anything with address
47:46
beginning 199 something or 223 18 0-23 you can send it to me okay
47:57
so it's like saying oh if you have anything going to
48:03
um Pennsylvania or California Sacramento you can send it
48:09
to me it's like that okay
48:25
so you may see you may think oh then it's there is some confirm for example
48:31
if I send I have something going to Sacramento it's certify both conditions is it belongs to
48:39
California and it's also belonged to California Sacramento then in this case should I send the package to
48:45
the flyby Knight ISP or the SP Rus
48:51
can you guess can you type in the chat which one if we use one to represent this two to
48:58
represent this so if we have a package going to California Sacramento will you
49:05
send this to one or two okay we will choose to send to two
49:11
because we know California's Sacramento is a longer address it's more accurate
49:16
right so it's the same thing it's the same thing if you have an
49:22
address that matches both this sorry matches both this address and
49:28
also this address then please remember a principle we learned before that is
49:34
called the longest prefix matching then we will choose the one that matches
49:39
longer okay that matches longer so it's called longest prefix matching if you cannot
49:46
remember let me remind you
49:54
do you remember here we learned it right if it matches both
50:00
um addresses then we will choose the one that matches longer okay it's called longest prefix matching so that's why uh
50:09
this kind of hierarchical addressing is actually very flexible if we want to
50:14
move one organization from one ISP to another ISP this organization does not
50:22
need to change the IP addresses the only thing it needs to do is the ISP will
50:28
simply add this address space in its own advertisement okay so that's a
50:36
that's the thing and then you may also ask how can ISP get a block of addresses
50:42
the answer is that it will need to get this block of addresses from ICA and N
50:49
okay the internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers uh this
50:54
organization will allocated addresses manage the DNS and
50:59
assign the mean names uh result the disputes okay
