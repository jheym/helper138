0:03
all right so the next thing we are going to introduce is the nut Network address
0:11
translation okay uh I think you probably heard about the local network or the
0:19
um the internal Network those kind of terms okay
0:26
so um you can see here we have a router and
0:32
we have the local area network okay this this Loop Network can be home network
0:38
can be um campus Network or any local area network so then the left part left part
0:46
is the rest of the internet okay so Network address translation
0:52
basically means basically means we will use
0:58
a 10 zero zeros slash 24 as the
1:04
Network address for a local area network okay for local area network
1:12
and then all so you can see this clients are all assigned a IP address
1:19
within this range okay within this range then when this
1:25
when when the um datagrams for when a packet comes from one client
1:32
and goes through the router okay then
1:38
the packet will uh the source address was originally 1001 right so then when it goes out of
1:46
the round trip we will change the source address into this one
1:51
okay into a public address okay
1:57
then um this this is this is like for example for your family okay for my
2:04
family for example for my family San family okay um we may have a outside name like sun
2:12
okay but uh within our family we may simply name
2:18
ourselves one two three four like that okay and then for any other
2:26
families they also have an outside name okay but within their family they only
2:32
call themselves one two three four okay it's like that so in this case in
2:38
this case we will say all the datagrams leaving the local network have the same
2:45
single Source net IP address which is this one and they have different Source phone
2:51
numbers okay the diagrams with Source or definition in this network have this
2:57
address for source and destination okay I know you are you still maybe you
3:04
still feel like you you are confused okay
3:09
um we will explain more okay don't worry so why do they use net you think about
3:14
this you think about this okay one major reason is that we for IP
3:21
address it is 32-bit okay IP address is 32-bit that means for
3:29
this entire internet we have at most 2 to 32 IP addresses
3:39
pay attention this is not a large number this is actually a small number compared
3:44
to the number of devices we are having right now okay so we can run out IP addresses very
3:51
soon okay then people begin to think how can we address this problem
3:57
then they come out of one solution one solution is that how about for this
4:04
entire local area network they just use one IP address okay it's like public IP
4:11
address but internally they all use the IP address so ten zero
4:17
zero something okay then to the outside this entire
4:23
local area network uses only one IP address but actually they can they have
4:28
a lot of devices okay then for other local networks for example there is one maybe for sex date
4:36
okay and then for UCD we may have uh we may also use just one IP address okay
4:42
but we may have thousands of machines within that so we may we may denote those machines also within
4:50
1000 1000 slash something okay so basically
4:56
10 0 0 is is like a special address that
5:01
is used for net okay and then in this case in this case
5:07
an entire local area network only need one IP address but but we can actually
5:12
denote a lot of devices using the internal address okay so that is uh I would say one
5:21
motivation for using net I hope you understand this it's like for my family
5:27
to the outside we only use the Sun as the the public name okay but inside
5:33
we use one two three four and this one two three four can be reused by other families okay this name can be used by
5:40
other families in this way we do not occupy a lot of family family names okay it's like that
5:46
uh any questions
5:52
okay so then now let's look at the motivation the motivation we have
5:57
several more motivations and then we will discuss uh how that works okay
6:03
so the motivation uh for net is that the local network uses just one IP address
6:11
as far as outside world is concerned
6:16
because of that okay uh we also we all we also want to
6:21
do several things um several more things first thing the range our addresses
6:28
is not needed for my SP because we just need one IP address
6:34
for all the devices of course internally we still need to
6:39
distinguish those devices but we can just use the internal address okay 1000 something and this internal address can
6:47
be reused again and again for other local area networks okay
6:52
and then another benefit is if we want to change the addresses or
6:59
devices in the local network we do not need to notify the outside world
7:05
that means if someday I'm not happy about the architecture for my network I
7:10
can change the structure freely but I don't need to tell the outside Network okay
7:16
second benefit the third benefit we can also change the SP without changing the
7:24
addresses of devices in the local area network case one day we are not happy with the
7:29
internship we want to change to Comcast is fine you don't need to change the addresses
7:36
or devices in the local network although maybe the outside public IP address has
7:42
been changed okay and the fourth benefit is about security the
7:51
device is inside the local area network is not are not explicitly addressable or
7:57
visible by the outside world okay so this is very good because the outside
8:03
world cannot directly uh communicate or can cannot
8:09
directly address uh device within the local area network so this is adding a
8:16
layer of security actually okay so now let's look at how how uh is the
8:24
net implemented okay um so basically the net router must do
8:30
several things for the outgoing datagrams okay for the outgoing datagrams we need to replace the source
8:38
IP address and Source port number of every Optical integram to the next IP
8:46
address and a new phone number okay basically replacing the internal address
8:53
internal port number with some out um uh
8:59
external or we can see uh public IP address and a new phone number
9:05
okay and then uh of course when the remote clients or servers respond to this
9:12
package they will respond to the net IP address and the net port okay they will
9:19
not respond to this one because they do not know this one okay and then because they are responding to
9:27
this one then when it comes to when the response comes to the net router the net router
9:33
needs to replace
9:39
um the net address okay with the real IP address and port
9:46
number okay so that is uh what the net router should do let's look I mean I mean you
9:52
may be confused still no it doesn't matter let's look an example and you may feel uh clear okay
9:59
so now we have the internal addresses of 100123 and 4.
10:07
okay and then we have a public address which is 138 76 29 7.
10:15
and this router need to have a translation table next translation table
10:21
the next translation table has the one side and also the land side okay so now
10:28
we assume there is a packet from 1001 okay ten zero zero one cents a
10:36
datagram to this destination address this port number so you can see it is
10:41
communicating with a web server and then we know the source address
10:46
should be 1001 and Source Port is three through four five this is a real part that means
10:53
this computer is actually listening to this port okay the definition we know is 128 119 40 186
11:02
okay for Destination Port is 18. when this datagram come to the router goes
11:10
through the router the router will need to replace the source
11:16
address with the public address
11:21
okay and the source port number is also replaced it's replaced with 5001
11:29
okay and then
11:35
and then pay attention the next translation table in the net transformation table the router also
11:42
write down this pair write down this pair okay basically this support number of
11:48
5001 here is referring to this
11:55
IP address and port number pair okay five zero zero one is representing
12:02
this 1001345 pair okay and then this packet is sent to the
12:10
server the server will respond when the server respond you can see the server
12:15
actually is bounded to you can see the source address is the
12:20
original destination address this is Source address softball number the server is replying to
12:27
this public IP address and 5001 because this is what is provided to the
12:35
server okay what was provided to the server that's why the server is replying to this one and again when this package third goes
12:42
through the router the router will need to check this table and say okay this IP address and this
12:51
port number 501 is actually matched to 1001345
12:59
so this router will replace replace the destination address to the
13:06
original address which is 1001345 okay and then now the packet can
13:14
be sent to 1001.0045
13:19
okay so here pay attention this five zero zero one is that's a real
13:25
pot number is a is that a real port when I say real Port I mean is there any
13:32
machine listening to this port is there an emotion listening to 5001
13:39
the answer is no 5001 is not a real post number because
13:45
nobody is listening to this port instead this is more like a identifier
13:53
an ID to denote this address and sort and Port pair okay but this 3345 is a
14:03
real Port because this 1001 machine is actually listening to this port okay
14:08
foreign now if we have another machine
14:14
10002 for example if it is sending out a packet also
14:21
okay if we have at the land side if we have 1002
14:28
okay this machine is sending out a datagram with the spot number one two three four
14:33
and then when it goes through the one side we can use a different phone number to denote this pair
14:40
okay and some of you may ask what if what if we have the same machine 10001
14:50
but a different point number maybe four five six seven what if this is
14:57
going through the router what can we do should we also give it a new phone number the answer is yes
15:11
okay so in this case as long as there is something and as
15:17
long as either the IP address or port number is different then we will need to
15:22
assign a new phone number to that a new one-sided phone number so basically as I
15:27
said this port number this port number is used to identify
15:34
this pair okay not just the IP address or just the port number okay
15:40
so now you can see um if we come back to review
15:46
the motivation again the motivation is also the benefits okay so then we know okay
15:54
for this entire local network we only need one IP address one IP address for
16:00
all the devices okay and if we want to change the internal IP address we don't
16:06
need to notify the upside world if we want to change the ISP we don't need to
16:12
change the structure or the addresses or the devices in the local area network because they are all using
16:18
the internal address is 100 something okay um
16:24
and also the device is inside the local area network are not explicitly
16:30
addressable or visible by the outside world so now you can see oh yes we
16:35
indeed have those benefits okay and some some of you may worry
16:41
um so how many devices open numbers can
16:46
be accommodate okay so you don't need to worry too much because for port number
16:54
for post number is
17:00
so that means that we can have as much the 2 to 16
17:06
different pairs different IP address and the phone number pairs okay so
17:14
um usually that is I would say that is sufficient for a regular size Network
17:21
okay um so that means we have sixty thousand
17:26
SEMA we can have at most sixty thousand um around 60 000 simple continuous
17:33
connections with a single landside address okay and pay attention this next
17:39
translation table is actually um is actually Dynamic okay which means
17:45
for example when this first connection is done when the communication is down we can actually delete this one
17:52
we can we will remove this pair from the net translation table okay and then uh
17:59
this is a port number of five zero zero one can be reused by some other
18:04
connections okay that's why usually it's sufficient because we can have
18:10
um 2 to 16 simultaneous connections with one single Landslide address okay and
18:18
this is dynamically changing okay but that is also very it's also
18:23
controversial because uh we know we assume the routers should only process
18:29
up to layer 3 which means Network layer which means we only deal with the IP
18:35
addresses Etc in the network layer okay we should not we should not address deal
18:41
with the port numbers processes uh in the network layer right uh but you can
18:49
see that actually while it's this end-to-end argument that is dealing with
18:54
the processes okay why because net is dealing with the port number so we know Paul numbers are
19:01
associated with the processes okay so that's why net is actually uh
19:06
controversial and people are thinking oh uh net is a solution a good solution to
19:13
address shortage the IP address shortage but it's not the final eventual solution
19:19
which we need to find out some other Solutions that's why eventually the
19:24
address shorter problem is actually sold by the ipv4 sorry iqb6 okay IPv6
19:32
and another thing I want to quickly talk about is the icmp okay icmp is the full
19:38
name is internet control message protocol so this is used by the house and routers to communicate Network level
19:46
information uh basically this is for Arrow reporting for example if you have
19:51
some hosts and reachable or some Network unreachable some port and reachable okay
19:57
so you may do error reporting using icmt and sometimes this can also be useful
20:02
for Echo Equity requests or reply okay
20:08
um so icmp is actually um it's not it's still it still belongs to
20:15
network layer but it's also viewed as a layer above the IP there okay about the
20:23
um IP layer so that means um the icmp messages are actually
20:28
carried within the IP datagrams okay we will see that a lot later
20:34
so for the ICM key messages usually it contains uh the type the code and then
20:42
uh also the a short description okay and also your list can hit that
20:49
sorry not the crucial difference is actually the first eight bytes of iptogram causing the error so
20:56
um here is uh the different type and code actually means different things so this is the short description for the
21:03
type and code for example if you have type 3 code 0 that means the destination
21:12
network is not reachable if you have a type 3 code 1 that means
21:18
that that's neutral host is not reachable okay so I select that and
21:23
um I think we use the one thing before for example if it's type 11 code 0 this means TTL
21:32
expired okay if you still remember the trace route before we talk about Trace
21:39
routes before right so how is Trace router is done we we remember we know
21:44
um usually this client will need to send for example uh one package of course
21:54
usually each time we send out three for three probes okay but for all those three packets they have the TTL equal to
22:00
one okay so TTL was set to one and when they arrive at the router we will need
22:07
to minus one on the current GTL so 1 minus one TTL now because it becomes
22:12
zero okay so when it becomes zero when it becomes zero we know the TTL expires
22:20
okay when it expires then this router needs to send back an icmp message to
22:27
the source okay with type 11 code 0. so
22:32
type 11 equals zero this TTI expire then after this response is sent to the
22:40
client The Source The Source will write down this message okay and then it will
22:46
know okay the information about the first voucher the second time okay we will send out
22:53
TTL equal to True okay a second set with three probes this time the TTL is set to
22:59
two so two then that this means the practice can travel two hops so whether
23:06
it arrived at um the first round for TTL becomes one when to arrive that here TTL becomes two
23:14
sorry zero y minus one equal to zero and then
23:20
TTL expires we will need to send back to the source send send the this error
23:27
message to the source with type 11 code 0 okay at the same time this router will
23:34
also need to send back its own information so then with this when this message is received by The Source The
23:40
Source will record the name of the router and the IP address Etc okay
23:47
so we will continue until
23:52
um we reach the destination Okay so
23:57
then you can see in this process actually the trace around function is implemented with icmp
24:07
messages okay is implemented with icmp messages and the the reason that choice route can
24:15
work is because every time when the TTL expires the ICM icmp message with type
24:23
11 code 0 will be sent back to the source together with the router's
24:28
information okay so for the icmp
24:35
um this is uh the general information so we have first an icmp message and then we have the header then this entire
24:42
thing is actually uh encapsulated here in the datagram and with the IP header
24:51
okay IP header obviously this is actually a network layer header and then we have the datagram and then here is
24:59
actually right this should be link layer okay and then we have nuclear headers like that okay
25:06
um so you can see here in in this example
25:11
icmp is like the TCP or UDP right so you have the payload and then you have TCP
25:18
UDP header and then it is in capital state encapsulated within the datagram
25:24
and then you need to add the network layer header and then you add the link layer header it's like that okay
25:31
for net although it is a very good way to use um so the IP shorted problem it
25:38
is not the final solution as we mentioned because we suppose the router only deal with the network layer up to
25:45
the network layer right but net is dealing with the port numbers port number belongs to process okay which it
25:53
belongs further belongs to the transport layer so that's why we say oh okay net
25:59
is not the final solution then what is the final solution so the final solution is IPv6 so what is
26:09
IPv6 basically originally ipv4 in version 4 we have 32 bits as the IP
26:16
address now we want to make this much longer okay we want to make this much longer we
26:24
want to make this 128 bits the IP address we can make it 128 bits
26:32
then now we can accommodate 2 to 128 devices at least right we can that means
26:39
we can have we can have that many IP addresses for the entire world okay of
26:46
course there are some other motivations for IPv6 for example uh the header
26:51
format hubspeed processing or forwarding so basically we can add some information
26:57
in the header to help speed up this the processing okay
27:04
um and also uh the header uh changes are made to facilitate quality of uh service
27:12
okay that is another motivation um for the datagram format pay attention
27:20
for IPv6 for ipv4 we can still remember how many bits we um
27:27
how many bits we had so sorry how many bytes we had for the entire header so
27:34
generally it is uh 20 bytes for the entire handle ipv4 right so 20 plus
27:41
bytes as the header but for IPv6 um the the header lens is about 40 bytes
27:50
okay it's much longer one of the major reasons because the IP address becomes
27:56
longer so you can imagine original Source address destination address in total is 64 bits now it's a 128 times 2
28:05
which is a 256 bits okay and also for IPv6 we do not allow any fragmentation
28:13
no fragmentation is allowed if you still remember
28:18
we may learn about ipv4 one major component is actually fragmentation
28:25
fragmentation means as we said we have Network links right so some links are
28:33
um some links have a bigger capacity or bigger bandwidth something has a smaller
28:39
bandwidth then in this case uh and and they can accommodate and
28:46
comment the different the size of the package measurement maximum segment size
28:52
okay so then when a bigger packet comes to a narrow
28:58
link We how to break this bigger package into smaller pieces that is called
29:03
fragmentation but in IPv6 we do not allow fragmentation that's the that is
29:09
something you need to pay attention okay so then some of you may ask oh uh if we
29:17
do not allow fragmentation then what if a big packet comes to
29:24
a narrow link which can accommodate only small packets
29:29
what can we do so in this case we need to modify the icmp protocol
29:38
correspondingly okay in icmp protocol we need to add one more type
29:45
okay with one more code saying oh this packet is too big
29:50
okay now in this case if a pack is too big then this package will this uh um
29:56
package will be dropped and the Pat the error message will be sent back to the source and then the source Will based on
30:03
that will adjust the size of this packing and send a smaller one okay so that's how it works
30:11
um for IPv6 datagram format let's look at this together so basically each row is
30:19
32 bits which is four bytes
30:25
okay um and you can see
30:35
so this this will take four rows
30:41
this will take four rows
30:47
okay now you can see firstly we have the version number this shows V6 or V4 okay
30:55
now of course here it will be V4 V6 sorry and then we also have priority
31:01
priorities used to identify um uh priority among the datagrams in
31:08
the flow okay and we will also have the flow label although the concept of flow
31:13
is not well defined yet okay and then we will have the payload lens okay this is
31:22
the length of the payload pay attention which means the data the length of the data then this is the
31:30
next header next header basically means uh the upper layer protocol for the data
31:36
for example is our player TCP or UDP okay or even maybe icmp
31:43
and this is the Hop limit hop limit is similar to TTL and then we will have four rows of
31:51
source address which is which has a 128 bits and four rows of uh destination
31:58
address okay so you can say in total we have one two three sorry one two plus
32:06
eight so in total we have 10 rows
32:11
and we know each row is four bytes
32:18
so that is in total 40 bytes of data okay for device of data or 40
32:26
bytes of hydro we should say okay so now pay attention let's review all the
32:31
headers we have learned okay so for UDP we know the header length is uh it buys
32:38
for TCP the Headlands is about 20 bytes or 20 plus bytes
32:44
IP Windows about 20 bytes okay ipv4 IPv6
32:50
is about 4 device okay and there are some other changes from
32:57
ipv4 for example checksum is removed entirely to reduce the processing time
33:04
at each hop because we know for UDP and TCP they
33:09
have the checksum already so now we remove checksum at the network layer and
33:14
options are allowed but it is outside of the header it is indicated by The Nest
33:21
header field so if we have in the next header field if we have an indicator see
33:27
there is option then this option will will not be included in within the
33:33
header okay um and as I said as I said because we have a new version of I IP then we also
33:42
need a new version of icmp okay um so the additional message type may be
33:50
added such as package to big okay so those are uh the major changes
33:57
from ipv4 to V6 um but they're when we upgrade to IPv6
34:04
there is a problem we need to we need to address so the problem is basically me
34:10
is basically uh that we cannot we cannot upgrade all the routers
34:17
simultaneously that means we cannot say oh okay today
34:23
I'm going to shut down the entire internet and I will upgrade the router all
34:30
together can we do that we cannot so for the current Internet we cannot afford
34:37
such kind of flag dates okay then the problem becomes
34:43
um how could this network operate with a mixed ipv4 and V6 launchers so some
34:49
routers are able to read ipv4 packets some are
34:54
able to read ipvc vouchers so what can we do okay if a packet is traveling in
35:02
such kind of mixed routers then uh what can I do okay so then people began to
35:07
think um a very obviously very smart way okay it's called tunneling tunneling
35:13
basically means uh the IPv6 datagram is carried as the payload in the ipv4
35:24
datagram among ipv4 routers Okay so
35:30
usually usually for example IPv6 vouchers uh can still read itv4 packets
35:39
so um because IPv6 routers are more advanced
35:45
right so we can we can say okay you can backwardly accomplish those
35:51
um order format of packets but it's hard it's very hard for ipv4 routers to
35:59
understand the new package the IPv6 package okay so then in this case as I
36:05
said what we do is we basically incorporate
36:11
in we basically reported this this is this is actually our IPv6
36:21
so this is the IPv6 datagram it is put into an ipv4 datagram to view it as the
36:30
payload ipv4 payload okay then in addition to that we are
36:35
adding the ipv4 headers and ipv4 Source address destination address then this
36:42
IPv6 datagram is able to travel through
36:48
the old routers okay um so of course you can see in the IPv6
36:55
because this is this IPv6 Instagram is a complete dead form so you still have
37:01
IPv6 header fails uh the source Station address and also the udptcp payload
37:07
within this IPv6 datagram okay any questions so far
37:16
all right so let's look at this uh this view okay this is the tunneling
37:23
and we have those uh new routers IPv6 launchers and we also have ipv4
37:32
routers okay as we said if we have for example
37:38
um so you can you can view this as a tunnel okay you you can view those ipv4
37:44
routers as a Time Tunnel connecting those IPv6 launchers then if we have a
37:51
datagram from a for example the source is a destination is f
37:56
uh it is from one V6 router to another V6 router
38:02
okay so then we it might is traveling from A to B we know it is still a V6 uh
38:09
datagram then when it is traveling to
38:14
um to router C okay we know router C is the V4 router so then we have to you can see
38:22
we have to wrap this IPv6 datagram with a V4 uh headers okay with the V4
38:32
header so we basically added the source as B destination as e okay and then
38:40
this becomes a V4 package so it can travel through C and D finally it will
38:46
arrive at e okay when it arrived at e then e can remove the V4 header and take
38:53
out the V6 datagram and then it can continue travel to other V6
38:59
um routers okay so this is the entire process
