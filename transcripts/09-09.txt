0:04
is this all clear
0:12
okay good thanks so that's the choice drugs program as I
0:19
said later we are going to uh we will see how this is implementing icmp but uh
0:26
but this this is generally the design okay the design of this uh this uh
0:32
um program and then you can see how the international internet delay
0:38
um look like in reality okay and for packing loss I think we can skip
0:45
this part because we mentioned the packet loss happens because
0:51
the buffer of the router is full okay so this is the only thing you need to know
0:56
we have to drop this uh the incoming package when the buffer is a full that's how packet loss
1:03
happens okay and this may again be the uh test question
1:09
then the next thing we are going to look at is the throughput okay
1:14
so throughput in general this uh the definition is the rate at which these
1:20
are transferred between the sender and the receiver okay of course we may have instantaneous
1:27
throughput okay which means the read at a given point in time okay and we may
1:33
also have the average throughput for example you you can calculate within one hour
1:40
okay how many how much how many bits are sent from this sender to the receiver
1:48
okay then we can calculate that Our Roots output okay and then the
1:53
instantaneous uh throughput may be very high at one point but maybe low at the
1:59
other point the average throughput is like it's a it's usually
2:04
um fixed okay um then but the throughput is also
2:11
determined by the link okay is determined by the length so for
2:18
example now if we have a sender and receiver
2:23
okay a center of the receiver then the sender wants to send some beats
2:30
to the receiver and this package the package may have to go through a number
2:35
of links okay you can see in the middle is actually a router okay and then we
2:40
may have the link at the left Link at the right okay so this these links may
2:46
have different capacities do you remember do you remember we learned this before we talked about different type of
2:53
links before right we have fibers which may have a very high link capacity we
2:59
have Wi-Fi or even mobile network which may have a very low link capacity
3:07
okay so it's different then how can we determine the hourly
3:13
throughput in this case or the effective algorithm throughput okay so now you can
3:20
imagine now you can imagine these two links are like the pipes carrying the
3:26
water okay the left pipe has a one rate the second second the
3:34
right pipe has another rate so what that means one pipe may be very very narrow
3:39
it carries the water and the water can flow very very slowly
3:46
but the other pipe may be very wide okay then the water can flow very fast
3:54
Okay then if this is a P1 pipe one this is P2 and the window P1 is very very
4:03
narrow P2 is very wide so let me ask you a question
4:08
the speed of this water flow from the computer A to B
4:15
so the flow the speed of this water flow is determined
4:22
by by P1 or P2 if P1 is very narrow P2 is very wide
4:34
let me repeat the question again if P1 is very narrow P2 is very wide
4:39
then the speed of the water flow between A and B is determined by P1 or P2
4:49
P1 great excellent I I also say the answers from the chat yes it is actually
4:56
determined by P1 by the one which has the smaller
5:04
um read or the smaller throughput right so this is exactly the same thing
5:11
in the networking in the networking if we have a link which has a small bandwidth and another link which has a
5:18
higher bandwidth okay then the effective throughput is actually determined by the
5:26
one with smaller bandwidth okay
5:31
question answer question is that the same as download speed you I think you are mentioning uh the throughput
5:40
um you also said bandwidth so throughput here equals to
5:45
um is like um is how many bits we can carry of
5:51
course the downloading speed the downloading speed can be measured by the throughput okay but I do not see they
5:58
are exactly the same because we also have uploading speed right okay
6:04
um so bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth is uh very related to throughput okay but
6:13
as you can see here when we see bandwidth we we mean the bandwidth for specific link for example for P1 we may
6:20
have a benefit of RS for P2 we may have bandwidth of RC
6:26
okay but the throughput is actually determined by the one with the the one
6:33
the smaller parameter I would say okay the smaller bandwidth
6:38
is this clear to everybody
6:43
okay good so then now you can look at this example in this example if RS is smaller than RC
6:52
okay RS is uh is the capacity being capacity or the bandwidth
6:58
foreign the left link and RC is for the right link so then in this case
7:07
sorry in this case what is the average n through end-to-end throughput or the
7:12
effective end-to-end throughput that is RS okay how about if RS is bigger than
7:19
RC when RS is bigger than RC
7:24
in this case then what is the average end to end through to order the
7:30
effective entry throughput excellent you are all choosing the smaller one okay some of you may think
7:37
oh the bigger one is on the left then probably it can be faster no even I mean
7:44
if you again imagine if this is water even the left side we can flow in the
7:50
water very fast okay but when it comes down to a narrower pipe
7:56
the water speed has to slow down has to decrease that's why
8:02
again the effective end-to-end throughput is still determined by the
8:07
smaller one okay that's why it's RC excellent so then we can say
8:14
um those ones like rsrc the smaller one is or the smallest one is actually
8:20
called the boat neck bottleneck link okay which means
8:27
um the link on the end to end path that constraints the end-to-end throughput
8:34
okay with this bottleneck link usually has the smallest link capacity or the
8:42
smallest bandwidth okay so that's why uh when you think
8:47
about uh for example when you are talking to another computer while your computer is talking to another computer
8:53
far away you can never predict what happens in between right so there may be one Link
8:59
in between okay with that constraints the end-to-end throughput okay then in this
9:05
case it may um affect your network okay but the good
9:11
thing the good thing is that we have we also have the rocking algorithm okay that our routing
9:18
algorithm is going to matter the delays between two hops okay like between two routers
9:24
if this link is not fast enough if this link has a very very long delay okay
9:31
then the router routing algorithm will will try to roll out this uh delay roll
9:39
out to this link okay it will not include this link into the path that's how we can mitigate this problem okay
9:50
um this is another scenario in this scenario you can see we have about 10 connections okay between
9:58
these 10 computers and these 10 computers can help out 10 connections
10:04
and then you can see for each path
10:10
each path is each part includes basically three segments so the first segments the first
10:17
link okay it has RS the second link
10:25
okay the second link is actually determined by what by the total number of links
10:33
okay so we know in total this is our the bandwidth is R but this is shared by by
10:40
10 paths okay so that's why by 10 links that's why actually each one each link
10:48
can only get a tenth of work okay and then third portion we have we
10:55
have RC then in this case in this case if I ask you what is the effective end-to-end
11:02
throughput between a and b so what would be the answer
11:08
what do you think what is the effective end-to-end throughput between a and b
11:17
again again we know one thing for sure we need to choose the smallest one right
11:24
we need to choose the smallest one among these two because the smallest one is
11:29
the botnet link okay the bottleneck link so that's why actually the average or the effective
11:37
end to end throughput is the minimum of RC RS and R Overton whichever is the
11:45
smallest okay then that one will become the effective end-to-end robot
11:52
what about throughputs between routers okay if we come back to this
11:59
to this um slide so
12:05
actually this is uh this uh the the computer A and B are connected
12:12
uh we uh are connected by those vouchers okay so when we say we want to find the
12:19
smallest one okay that means uh those links are actually divided by the
12:25
routers so now for example if we have computer a foreign
12:35
so for example
12:44
okay so then you can see if we have
12:58
so if these are the links the link capacity between a and uh
13:07
R1 R1 and r2r201 R3 and utterance B then
13:13
you can see a mod can you tell me what is the effective end-to-end throughput
13:19
on this path first one is 10 second one is the five third one is 20 BPS the last one is 100
13:27
BPS so what is the
13:32
effective and to end the robot between A and B can you tell me in this
13:40
example now choosing five that's correct if you want to say for example what is the
13:45
effective N20 slope would be turned R1 and R3 then I would say
13:51
between R1 and R3 we have 5 and 20. so I would say 5 is
14:00
the one okay but usually we we will look at only the end to end which means computer to computer
14:06
okay from A to B yes that's something that can be manually assigned by the
14:13
router or the router automatically assigning those links
14:18
um no that is not determined by the router okay that is actually determined
14:25
by the infrastructure so for example if this this is if a is
14:32
your home computer okay then you are connecting to your router using
14:39
something and this can be
14:46
this can be Wi-Fi this can be
14:54
internet if you are using a cable okay so then because you are using different
15:00
ways to connect to the router then the speed is different the ethernet is probably much faster than the Wi-Fi
15:07
okay the internet has the that link that cable has much higher capacity or more
15:14
higher bandwidth do this make sense then between R1 and R2
15:21
depending on what internet service provider you are using probably you are
15:27
using Comcast and atnt may claim say hey there we are providing fiber then if
15:35
they are providing fiber then their their link bandwidth is much higher than the ones from Comcast
15:42
okay so it really depends on what kind of links do you use to connect those
15:49
ruptures or the computers okay those are all great questions so then
15:54
you can see it has nothing to do with the routers it's basically purely uh
15:59
related to the link types if it is in the test I give you some
16:06
questions like this I hope you know how to calculate the
16:11
end-to-end throughput actually you don't need to do any calculation just through the smallest one but still in a in a
16:18
test in the previous exams I still saw a lot of students doing calculations okay
16:25
so for example if I if for this example if I ask you what is the average throughput between a and b
16:31
okay you know what many students would do 10 plus 5 plus 20 plus 100 divided by
16:38
four that is something you should definitely avoid okay it's not calculated in that
16:45
way it's actually just um determined by the smallest one
16:52
okay pay attention to that unless this continue to discuss the
16:57
protocol layers okay so
17:03
um I have been mentioning this layer thing for a long time okay I mentioned this
17:09
again again but why do we have protocol leaders what does this mean okay so if
17:14
you think about the networking the networks are actually very complex okay
17:20
it has a lot of different components and pieces you think about this we have the
17:25
the host the links and we turn the links so we have we have the routers the
17:30
switches and we may also have different applications you are running email you
17:36
are using web service you are using file transferring right and then we also have
17:42
different protocols okay we know those are like rules to follow all the standards
17:48
um to control uh the different components and we also have the hardware
17:53
the software so how how can we you can see these are
17:58
different pieces here and there scattered right so how can we combine or integrate these different
18:06
pieces to make it work in just one internet okay this is actually a very challenging
18:13
problem right a very challenging problem then the question is is there any hope
18:19
of organizing the structural Network okay or at least the one we discuss something
18:26
for example we just discuss application or when we discuss a protocol what are
18:32
we referring to okay so so we we at least have some
18:37
Foundation or some kind of framework for us to to start the discussion so that is
18:43
actually the problem for networking okay that's why uh graduate people
18:51
um propose one uh model called OSI model OKAY Open
18:58
System interconnection model which contains seven layers the seven layers
19:03
are actually uh uh it's uh it's like an analogy to The Postal Service
19:11
okay so let's look at the Postal Service uh when you write a letter to a foreign
19:17
country for example okay so for first level course you need to write this 20 Page Letter
19:23
if I'm writing let's see a letter to my friend in China okay I may write in
19:29
English but he or she can only understand Chinese okay when you are writing a 20-page
19:36
letter this is like application layer the first thing you need to do but this letter has to be translated
19:43
so the receiver can read it this is what we call as presentation layer then when
19:50
it comes down we need to ensure the recipient can indeed receive the letter
19:56
okay how can we make sure he or she receives this okay we need to
20:01
establish some kind of session okay so that's the session layer then down below
20:07
okay down below one way when we have this like this 20 Page Letter
20:12
okay we need to separate and number of the pages why because sometimes for example uh
20:21
the Postal Service may not be able to carry a huge letter a long letter 20
20:26
pages right so you make you may only be able to send just one or two pages per
20:32
letter right so that's why you have to separate it into smaller pieces and then
20:38
maybe deliver it deliver you for example if we separate these 20 pages into uh in
20:45
20 pages into uh 10 different pieces so each piece has 20 has two pages okay
20:52
then those those 10 pieces will be sent out individually
20:59
okay individually so then this layer is called transport layer we separate and
21:04
number the pages okay um and we also need to make sure what if
21:09
some of the pieces are um lost what should we do how can we recover okay
21:15
this is also done as transport layer then down below is the network layer
21:21
Network layer basically means uh the Postal Center is sorting the letters by the zip code to Route them closer to the
21:28
destination so what is the shortest path from uh from you to your friend okay
21:33
that's the network layer and then one layer below is the local postal office
21:39
need to determine which vehicles are used to deliver the Legends okay
21:44
eventually we have the physical layer the physical layer is to
21:50
um is to carry the letter between different stations to to do delivery
21:55
using uh the the physical tracks the planes the real uh reels or the uh cars
22:04
okay so then that is a as the lowest layer we need to determine how we can
22:10
carry this letter between your place to post the first post office and from the
22:16
first person to the second puzzle second possible to the last one okay so it's uh
22:22
it's like that so this is how the analogy is done that's how the seven
22:27
layers are um extracted okay so the examinators are
22:32
application presentation session transport network data link and physical layer so if you want to remember these
22:39
seven years you can remember this all people seem to need data processing so you can look at the first letter okay
22:47
why do we need to uh have this kind of a layer okay um or is there a uh is there another
22:54
analogy for the layering so actually the error travel is a very good analogy for
23:00
the layering um if you think about the air travel usually you need to do the uh ticketing
23:06
right take it you you buy the ticket and then the next thing is you you need
23:13
to check in your bag and you go to the gates and then the plane take off then
23:19
the plane will do the routing and finally the plane arrives at this destination then we will have landing
23:26
and then gate you need to go to the Gates Again you need to claim the baggage uh usually we don't don't do
23:34
complaining that take it right but anyway um so you can see it's like a layer kind
23:40
of thing right here so why do we do this kind of layering
23:48
you think about this uh one one very important benefits okay one very
23:55
important benefit is the layering is providing a kind of
24:00
service to the other layers okay so for example for example
24:06
um the let's say the gates okay the guess is
24:13
like uh it's like providing service to the baggage part okay so that means okay
24:19
uh I need to I need to uh for example if one day you want to change your ticket
24:24
okay or if one day once you say um you want to
24:30
uh yes you want to change the ticket you you want to change the destination do you need to like worry about if the
24:39
airport has already uh processed your gate correctly so you don't need to
24:44
worry about that right so the gate itself is providing the service to the app layers select that okay
24:52
um and also you don't need to once your bag is clean is checked in you don't need to worry about the case also so
24:58
it's like that um basically one layer will provide a service to the other layers and these
25:04
layers are actually kind of isolated from each other um I should not say isolated but they
25:10
are independent from each other okay so if one layer is changed so for example
25:15
one day if we want to change um a routine of airplane we say okay we
25:21
don't want the plane to go through um Los Angeles you want to to go through
25:27
Chicago then it doesn't change it this routine changing doesn't change your
25:33
ticket okay uh your tickets the destination is still the same The Source
25:38
uh is still the same okay so it's like that um
25:44
so this is a the lettering that's that is actually one very important benefit I hope you understand
25:50
um another another um benefit is uh we as we said the computer networking is actually a very
25:57
complex system if we want to explicitly mention something or referring to
26:03
something okay then we need to um have something to refer to okay we
26:09
need to have some kind of a framework or reference model to identify the
26:16
different pieces different components in the networking okay so that's why we
26:21
need such kind of really uh layering okay so for example we can see when we talk about the email applications we met
26:28
when we talk about the service web services the web pages the web browsers
26:34
Etc you can say oh this is a application letter thing okay but when we talk about
26:40
the let's say reliable data transfer um when we talk about the sockets
26:48
then we should know oh okay that that belongs to the transporter layer similarly when we talk about the routine
26:54
algorithm um then we need to we we say oh okay this belongs to the
27:00
um uh the network layer okay so it's like that that's uh that's uh why we we
27:06
uh it's very important to have a explicit structure uh for
27:12
um reference okay uh the second thing we have mentioned the Hassan benefits is that we need to
27:19
help this kind of modularization this is very easy for
27:24
um for maintenance and for updating of the system why because if you want to
27:30
change the implementation of one layer it doesn't affect the other layers okay you don't need to change the other
27:37
layers implementation correspondingly that is the benefits uh but there is one
27:43
question for you to consider is the layering considered harmful
27:48
is this a 100 good thing is there any drawbacks for layering
27:56
can you think of any if you can you can type in the chat
28:07
you all think later is 100 good there might be counts yes
28:14
yes there might be consider them what are the potential accounts you can think of
28:24
too cohesive okay yeah good point
28:30
must be same standard right right okay
28:37
so I I think uh what you mean is uh within a layer we need to have the same
28:43
standard right
28:48
uh those are all good points very good so let me give you some hints if you
28:54
think about the layering uh the good thing is oh okay when we
28:59
refer to something we can always find a layer to to refer to right but the the
29:06
drawback is that also means if you want to refer to
29:11
something okay if you have something you want to refer to then you must put it into a layer okay you must put it into a
29:19
layer in order to refer to that okay so by you if you think about some
29:25
of the new features or new things we we consider in networking for example
29:31
when network was firstly uh designed nobody considered about security okay
29:37
security no layer is dealing with security there is no security layer right then we may
29:44
implement but now security becomes a problem when we implement this how which
29:49
layer should we put security okay should we put this to application
29:55
layer to transport layer or network layer you see that it fits over but
30:01
I mean it doesn't belong to any of these layers okay that is the actually the um
30:08
obviously the drawbacks or the counts uh of the layering thing okay that means if
30:15
you have some new components coming up due to the development of Technology you
30:20
need to you need to fit this new component into a specific layer but
30:26
sometimes this might be very difficult okay that's one thing you can you can
30:31
think about all right any any questions
30:39
okay so we talk about the seven layers of OSI
30:44
model but the question is in Internet do we really implemented those seven years
30:51
do we really have all those seven layers application presentation session
30:58
transport Network link physical do we have all those layers the answer is no
31:04
actually in real internet we only have uh I'll see in the internet protocols
31:11
that we have about five layers we have only five layers purely okay so for
31:16
example we have uh we have application layer transport layer Network layer link
31:22
layer physical layer as shown on the slide but we do not have the
31:28
presentation layer and the session layer
31:41
so these two layers are missing actually
31:48
again this may become a test problem I may ask you in the test what are the two
31:53
layers missing in the Internet Protocol stack okay
31:58
good question why are they missing why are they missing because in the in
32:05
the implementation okay during the implementation they found these two layers are sometimes optional and not
32:12
really necessary for the for the protocol for for the implementation okay
32:19
so gradually then people um think okay when if we if we want to
32:25
do if we want to implement some of the functionalities of presentation and session we can directly put them into
32:32
the application layer okay so that's why uh I mean it's it's
32:38
kind of a uh design uh design kind of thing so
32:44
that's the main reason why we do not all the information implementation kind of thing that's why we do not really have
32:51
these two layers uh in the Internet Protocol set okay
32:56
uh so basically gradually people realize okay if we have one message okay we can
33:03
break it into smaller pieces then there's some Breaking part is done as a
33:08
transport layer okay if you do not have any need I will doing uh translation
33:13
okay and you need a session because transport layer is also uh it's kind of
33:19
establishing a connection so some of the functionalities are kind of duplicate in
33:24
the other layers okay um so that's the main reason and now you
33:30
can say for the application layer the application layer is meaning to support the network applications as we said we
33:38
may have different applications and for each type of application it may use a specific
33:46
protocol okay for example FTP here is for trial file transfer file transfer
33:53
protocol this is the meaning for the file transferring service okay the SMTP SMTP
34:02
is a simple mail transfer protocol this is used for email service and HTTP you
34:08
are probably very familiar with the right so HTTP is used for web service
34:13
okay so you can see different application use different protocols
34:19
and then at transport layer we also have two types of protocols one type of TCP
34:25
the other type is UDP okay so TCP and udpr
34:30
um a very different and we're going to deal uh we are going to spend quite some time discussing these two type of TC uh
34:38
protocols so this is mainly dealing with the process to process data transfer
34:44
probably you for now you do not have the ideal process yet okay we are going to
34:50
screen more about this but anyway you need to know okay we have at least two type of protocols that
34:55
transporter layer the network layer we also have different protocols we have at
35:01
least we have IP protocol IP is used to determine for example the IP address how
35:08
is how IP address is uh is uh defined okay and we also have the
35:16
different routing protocols for networking okay we are going to discuss more about that the link layer we have
35:22
the ethernet which is for usually for the cable network okay and we also also
35:29
have the wireless now 80211 like Wi-Fi for wireless network so these are also
35:36
different tools of course there are more okay um like Bluetooth mobile networks
35:43
and then physically physically is basically the piece on The Wire the
35:48
zeros and the ones okay and if you if you look at this if we do not if we
35:53
ignore the physical layer okay if you look at the upper four layers
35:58
each layer has some protocols okay reside in that layer that's why we
36:06
call this as Internet Protocol stack okay and in the future also in the test
36:12
I may give you an application so for example I may say okay for HTTP that's
36:18
the application now what is the protocol used at the application layer you know it is HTTP right for web service and
36:26
then what is the protocol used for transport layer you can see this is uh this may be TCP okay and then what is
36:32
the protocol as the narrow player and say this is IP and what is the protocol nuclear this may be ethernet maybe Wi-Fi
36:39
okay so as you can see in order to support
36:44
foreign service okay
36:49
we need a a bunch of protocols actually okay from application layer to the link
36:55
layer so HTTP TCP IP or 80211 okay then
37:02
this is uh this is how the Internet Protocol stack is used to support this
37:09
map service okay that is the general idea for Internet Protocol stack
37:16
um and then you may you may ask so how about the other two layers in the OSI
37:21
model the presentation layer and the session layer okay so pay attention that again
37:28
reference model is just for reference it's like a framework but the protocol stack is a is the reality is what we use
37:37
in reality is for the real implementation okay so if you want to uh do some kind some
37:45
functionalities from the presentation layer and session layer okay so you may
37:51
do it in the application layer uh so for example if you want to do some encryption or comprehension compression
37:58
okay or do some machine specific conversions then in this case it's like
38:04
to interpret the meaning of the data right so then we can have some
38:11
functionalities implemented in the application layer okay uh to complete
38:17
those functions for example we all know that when you develop some application you can
38:23
call some encryption library right to do the encryption decryption so it's it's
38:29
like that and then for session layer session layer is used you usually used for a
38:36
synchronization uh checkpointing the recovery of data exchange okay so this
38:42
is uh obviously this part is um is uh actually implemented in the transporter
38:49
layer and the um yeah mainly the transporter layer actually for a data reliable data
38:57
transfer okay and of course the error checking those kind of thing uh
39:03
synchronization kind of thing is actually done at the link layer also okay different layer
39:10
they all have this kind of functionalities um okay so and again pay attention these
39:17
two layers are missing questions so far
39:24
whose hand are those handled by the application layer
39:29
or by the end systems uh so as I mentioned uh pay attention let's that
39:35
there is some very important thing I want to discuss here so we are talking about the Internet
39:41
Protocol stack here okay and the application layer
39:47
when we talk about the apple and the system you you may you should ask yourself what kind of what which layers
39:54
which layers are included in the end systems when we see the end system we
40:00
basically mean the devices right the um
40:05
computers the mobile phones Etc actually in reality the end system those
40:12
devices contain all the layers from application layer to
40:18
transport layer to network layer to link layer to physically all the layers are included in the end systems okay
40:25
because as you can you can think about on your computer we have the applications right we have the emails
40:32
the web browsers and then those messages messages need to be sent need to go
40:38
through the transport layer Network learning layer and I I'll explain more and you have a better idea about how
40:45
this happened but anyway the Ender system can hear all this okay
40:50
but the routers the routers have only had have only
40:57
three layers the routers have only up to network
41:02
clear the physical layer link layer Network layer okay that is uh for the router so when we talk about uh where is
41:12
uh the application the presentation layer functionality implemented we can see this is implementing application
41:19
layer okay then that means the application layer basically means it's most likely in an assistant
41:26
okay because routers do not have application here but for the session layer it's different
41:32
a second layer um the functionality is defined are like synchronization checkpointing recovery
41:39
of data exchange Etc then for those functionalities those are implemented in
41:45
multiple layers okay for example synchronization can be done at nuclear then link layer basically means uh it
41:54
may be in the in the systems and it may be in the routers does this make sense
42:01
okay yeah so so it's a like like it's an assistant and the
42:07
the uh the layer stack and the protocol stack is like two different uh Concepts
42:14
okay so we need to clarify that okay all right so that
