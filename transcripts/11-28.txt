0:03
the five-point assignment is like a summary of what we have learned so far
0:09
from chapter 1 to chapter five okay I hope we can review what we have covered
0:16
and give you like a whole picture of what we have learned okay
0:22
so basically um today we are going to look at a day in
0:28
the life of a web request okay it's like a story okay and next story
0:34
um and we want to look at every every layer we want to when we make a web
0:40
request we want to see what what is happening behind the scene okay
0:45
um for you probably when you use web browser you what you do is you only click on a button and then you you are
0:52
you are done right so you type in the URL you hit enter and then you are
0:58
waiting for the webpage but there are actually a lot of things happening behind the scene and we want to learn
1:05
what is happening okay what is the entire process okay
1:11
so basically our goal is to put it all together we call this as synthesis okay
1:18
so the goal is to identify review and understand all the protocols at all
1:24
layers involved in a simile um simple scenario so basically the
1:30
scenario is very easy a student attaches a laptop to the campus Network and then
1:38
make a request of google.com very simple scenario okay let's see what is
1:45
happening so firstly you can see uh this this is the Comcast network this is the
1:52
school network okay this is the web server and this is Google's network of course this web server belongs to Google
1:58
okay this is Google's web server and now we assume a laptop is connecting
2:06
to this machine connecting to this network school network okay and then uh we the student
2:13
then open the web browser and try to request google.com then of course what
2:20
will happen is uh Google's web server will return a web page right to the
2:26
students computer so this is a very simple scenario but actually yes
2:33
um from what we have learned before we know there are actually a lot of things happening
2:38
so first thing first thing keeping in mind when this computer joins the
2:44
network does this computer has uh have a IP address
2:50
it does not it does not have an IP address so it needs to firstly request
2:57
an IP address okay so how do we request the IP address
3:06
we all know that we have learned DHCP right the function of DCP protocol is
3:13
basically providing IP address to a newly joined computer
3:18
okay so then in this case we know in this case we know this computer
3:25
is making a dtcp request okay making a dtcp request and we know
3:33
that for dtcp it is application layer protocol and now pay attention we want to look at each
3:40
layer what what is the protocol used okay for application layer it is d2cp
3:46
for transport layer when it comes down to transport layer we
3:52
know we need to add a header transport layer header and this transport this transport layer
3:58
the protocol we we used should be UDP
4:03
not TCP so we haven't learned this before right I have explained why we should use only
4:12
UDP not TCP because current for TCP we know we need to establish a connection
4:18
between the source and the destination but here this computer itself does not
4:25
have any IP address yet and also it doesn't know who is the DHCP server who
4:32
is the destination okay so that's why it cannot make a TCP
4:37
connection that's why we have to use UDP so here I may have a test question
4:43
I will ask you what is the protocol used as the application layer what is the
4:48
protocol used at the transport layer so you should know those okay and then when
4:54
it comes down to a layer below we know we will use IP protocol right
5:00
um and then of course here we haven't started any like routine kind
5:06
of things yet but we will for sure add the source and destination IP address
5:11
okay and then it comes down the link layer if we are using ethernet okay then
5:17
we will use uh uh ethernet protocol okay the protocol for ethernet so you can see
5:23
uh finally then this packet comes down to physically here okay
5:28
and then next we know we know this this Frame
5:35
okay finally this Frame will be sent to the dtcp server but as we mentioned
5:43
we don't know who is the server yet okay so in this case what should we do
5:48
we actually we learned when we talk about the gcp we learned we should send
5:54
this to everybody this is called broadcasting right we should broadcast this message to everybody in this
6:01
network so then who how do we do the broadcasting we do broadcasting at
6:08
ethernet at the lower layer the link layer we know if we want to do the broadcasting we have to use the address
6:15
our 12 F's okay 12 F's on the left
6:22
okay so if the if this if we do broadcasting at the
6:27
um as the network layer we should use 255.255
6:41
.255.255 This Is How We Do broadcasting as the network layer so Network layer basically will specify the destination
6:48
address as a uh 255.255.255.255 but at the link layer if
6:55
we if we want to do broadcasting then we need to use 12 apps as the MAC address
7:01
as destination methodless okay I hope everything is clear so far okay then
7:08
after that we know uh the dtcb server will receive this message this request
7:15
and then begin to formulate a reply okay of course we know actually they're on a
7:22
number of uh back and forth Communications here but here we to
7:27
simplify the problem we just look at the last one okay how the dtcp server
7:34
formulated the reply the dtp server will basically a reply with
7:42
a message which contains the client's IP address
7:48
okay the IP address of the first hop router to remember
7:54
we have mentioned this for multiple times okay and also the name and IP
8:00
address our DNS server and if you remember we also have Network
8:05
mask okay so those are the information that
8:12
will be included in the reply message in the response message okay so the reason
8:18
that we want to provide not only the client IP address but also the other
8:24
information such as photo router IP address DNS IP address Network mask Etc
8:30
is basically introducing the network to this new camera okay to
8:37
this new camera so that's in the future this this computer will know who to contact okay so there you can see the
8:45
reply message is formulated and of course we are using UDP again okay at
8:52
the transport layer and the IP ethernet Fisk layer okay so
8:58
um so then you may ask how does this this switch
9:04
how does this switch know which link to forward you when this
9:12
packet comes in this Frame comes in the switch needs to forward it to this
9:18
new coming new camera right new computer then how does the switch know that we
9:25
should forward this to listening okay we actually have learned the switch
9:32
has a capability called self learning right self-learning then basically the
9:39
switch will have a table
9:48
a table called switch table okay in this switch table it will have the MAC address
9:58
the MAC address and the link output link um pair okay then so gradually the
10:06
switch will learn which Mac address is corresponding to which link so the
10:12
switch will know how to reach that computer okay so this is another thing you should keep in mind self-learning
10:22
okay so now now the client has
10:29
most of the information that it needs IP address its own IP address
10:34
the name and address of the DS server and the IP address of its first Hub
10:40
browser later we will know the first half router is also very important okay
10:47
so then the next thing is okay we want to send out the ATP request
10:55
right but we only know currently we only know google.com do we know the IP address of
11:03
google.com yet we do not know okay so then we have to use another protocol
11:09
called DNS okay DNS to make a request
11:15
to to get the IP address for google.com then in this case in this case again
11:20
okay uh we will application layer we will formulate a request that is the DS
11:27
request okay when it comes down to transport layer again we will add a header okay
11:32
and now you can see the transport layer is also using UDP
11:38
then it's also using UDP so here for DNS we can use TCP because we already know
11:47
um the DS server the DN server is IP address okay but
11:54
usually we we use UDP the major reason is is for uh is because UDP is much
12:01
faster okay it's much faster right we does not need to uh spend time on making
12:07
connections okay and we uh the UDP packet is also very lightweight we know
12:12
it has a much shorter header okay so we want to get this result as soon as
12:18
possible so that's the main reason we use UDP here at transport layer again okay so the lower layers are similar IP
12:27
ethernet and then physical layer okay um
12:33
but here we have a question so firstly we established the DNS query okay we
12:39
create this query and this is in cabinet encapsulating eodp
12:45
um in IP and ethernet then the next thing is we want to send this Frame to
12:51
the router okay we need to send this Frame to the to the router okay
12:58
and then now we need the MAC address of the
13:04
router right so we need the MAC address of the router if we want to send our frame to
13:12
it we all we know that we know that this router is actually the first Hub router
13:26
so pay attention you know some of you may ask why do we need to send this Frame to browser
13:31
because we know that the answer if you come back to
13:39
if you come back to this topology the DN server is actually in the Comcast
13:46
network and now this computer is in the school network okay so of course we will
13:53
need to send this to the first Hub router and then the first hole browser will forward the message for us to the
14:00
DN server and to to um to get the IP address for Google okay
14:06
so that's why we must contact this first Hub browser
14:11
and we already know the uh if we want to
14:17
contact this router we need to know the MAC address for this router right but now we already know the IP address for
14:25
this launcher how do we know so here I may ask you a question in the test how do you mean know the IP address
14:32
for this purpose of router and from what we have discussed here actually we know
14:42
how do we get that we gotta throw DHCP actually okay because DHCP protocol has
14:49
returned the IP address of the first up router that's how we get to learn about
14:55
this okay and now with this first hop
15:00
router's IP address okay so
15:05
so here let me
15:28
so our assumption here is we already know the IP address of the first hop
15:35
launcher how do we know we know the answer is DHCP okay we get to know this
15:41
through gcp and then the next thing is okay we now know the IP address of the
15:47
router that how do we know the MAC address of this router
15:52
so I want you to review what we have learned last time recall what we have learned last time if we already know the
15:59
id address of one interface if we want to know the I the MAC address for that
16:06
the corresponding Mac address then what we need to do is actually very easy
16:11
it's just uh using ARP right ARP address resolution protocol so what if they are
16:18
within the same line if they are within the same land then what we need to do is simply shouting to everybody simply
16:26
doing the broadcasting right so then basically this computer will send out an
16:32
Erp query to everybody asking say hey who has this IP address okay then that
16:40
router with this I uh IP address will reply with the MAC address with its own
16:49
Mac address okay so this is the ARP part okay uh and in the test in the final
16:56
exam I may ask you a question so how could the uh if the this is if this
17:03
computer wants to send a frame to the first Hub router then it needs the MAC address of firstcode browser so how
17:10
could this computer know the MAC address of this first Hub browser then you know the answer is actually Federal ARP okay
17:19
and then now we know the MAC address so then we can go ahead to send out the DNS query
17:26
okay the DNS query and okay we all also
17:32
know this DNS query will not stop here at the router it has to go through
17:39
um the network and finally reach the DS right and we also know if we want to
17:46
um know the MAC address of this DNS server okay we need to go through
17:53
also the Erp query right also the ARP query and we also know uh in this
18:00
process we actually need to change at this point okay at this point we need to change the
18:06
MAC address okay you you think about the sauce the
18:13
sauce mag
18:41
okay so when the frame leaves this computer okay now I use m1m2m through M4
18:49
to represent the MAC address for these different interfaces okay we know when
18:55
this when this Frame leaves the first computer okay the source Mac address is
19:01
actually M1 destination Mac address is actually M2 okay how do we know M2 we just we just
19:09
discussed we we do this through ARP query right and then
19:25
and then when the frame comes to here the the source
19:32
Max now becomes M third
19:47
uh actually it's even more complicated okay it's even more complicated now
19:54
because we have to go through two routers it's not just a wine router okay not just one router so then the
20:00
destination Mac is now has to be this Mac okay and then with this router will
20:05
have to change it again from uh this this Mac to this map so they say let's
20:11
see if this is M4 M4 M5 M6 okay this can be m
20:19
four okay um
20:24
and then here we need to make the MAC address as a source as M5
20:31
then destination as a M6 okay so uh but here for this part I will
20:40
not test you because this is getting more complicated um let's see I'll just erase this part
20:47
to make it easier to understand
20:56
okay uh but but if you still want to review okay if you want to have a better
21:03
understanding you'd better come back to the ARP protocol we have learned before
21:09
okay and um this this actually this slide
21:14
addresses the problem of routing to another uh lamp Okay how do we change
21:20
the MAC address so review that part again to have a better understanding but
21:26
anyway here here okay uh I will test you to that that depth the only thing you
21:32
need to know is actually within same line we know we have to send an Erp query then if we want to go across
21:40
different lines okay we also need to send out the ARP query
21:45
okay and then
21:53
okay we also need to send out the Erp query but but finally finally okay
22:00
finally this DNS requests need to be sent to the DN server okay and then in
22:06
this process in this process we need we know the router has to do some routine okay and then here is uh where we want
22:16
we want to consider the routine protocol so what kind of routing protocol can we use so we have learned the the internet
22:24
routine and the intra as routine right so for example for intra is routing we
22:31
learned the bgp we know there is ibdp and ebdp so they have different
22:37
um functions right so for EDP ebgp we
22:42
know it is using to it is used to learn reachability information
22:48
ipdp is then used to propagate the reachability information to everybody
22:54
inside this local area network okay that is a bgt then for OS for the intro as
23:01
routine protocol we know we can use ospf okay so those are the protocols that we
23:07
have learned for round team so here I want I want you to know only ospf and BJP
23:14
um and then finally this cancer will received this uh uh this DNS query and
23:20
you can see the headers are removed layer by layer finally the application
23:26
layer has the DS query then it will form a response
23:31
okay one more response and reply to the computer to the client the IP address of
23:39
google.com so now finally we get the IP address of
23:44
google.com okay then the next thing we need to do is okay now I have the IP address then
23:53
we can finally send out the HTTP request right so then you can see the computer
23:59
now forms a HTTP request and then a weight comes down to the transport layer
24:05
okay we know we must use TCP the reason is because we need
24:11
reliability okay we want this request to be sent without any error okay and of course
24:19
before we do data exchange we have learned this for many times
24:25
before we do this exchange we need to firstly establish a connection how do we
24:31
establish the connection we do three-way handshake do you still remember that okay we do three hashing to establish a
24:38
connection this is actually an extra step compared to UDP for UDP we do not
24:45
need to do any three hashing right we do not need to establish any uh connection
24:51
but for TCP for TCP we have to establish the connection
24:56
um so how do we do the three hatching we we know we firstly set the same into one
25:04
okay such thing into one and the AC key equal to zero
25:10
okay then the other side will reply with
25:20
with uh sorry with c equal to 1 AC equals to one okay
25:27
then finally we will have a confirmation from the client with
25:36
c equal to 0 is equal to one that's how we establish the connection okay
25:42
and then you can see this is sent this is sent this is actually the first step
25:47
this is sent to the server okay this is the first step sent to the server uh and
25:53
then the silver will formulate sing a c k okay this is the second step actually
26:00
this is this one
26:27
just this is the scene ack uh reply okay
26:32
and sorry it's too fast then it is sent back so you can see the client
26:39
um remove the headers layer by layer and actually there is another one finally
26:44
finally um uh the client will also confirm again with c equal to 0 AC k equal to one okay
26:52
this is the three-way handshake uh and then we know the TCP connection now
26:57
established okay so as a final step now the HTTP request
27:03
can be sent out okay and we add headers at each layer and we are using TCP and then this is
27:11
set to the server the server remove all the headers extracted HTTP request and
27:19
then finally form a response with the requested web page okay so then this is
27:28
this HTTP response actually has actually has the web page
27:34
in the data right so this is a response message it's a send back to the client
27:39
and finally the client now can remove all the headers lead by layer and then
27:46
extract the web page and display it on the web browser so this is the final step
27:52
um okay so that is uh the day in the live for the HTTP request and reply
27:59
uh actually you can see uh this is a this is a really long process right so if we summarize
28:07
the first step is DHCP the DCP is mainly used for getting the IP address for the
28:14
client and also get some information about the network for example the first
28:20
half routers IP address uh the IP address for the DS server and the network mask Etc okay so those are the
28:28
information that we get through the hcp server um and then the second protocol we use
28:34
is actually uh DNS because knowing only Google's
28:41
um hostname is not enough we need the IP address for this computer that's why we
28:47
need to um send out another DNS query
28:53
um and then finally we do HTTP okay then we
28:58
can send out the HTTP request and of course before the HTTP request we need to establish a connection first right
29:05
through Theory handshake um and then at lower layer at lower layer we know a lot of things has
29:11
happened for example how do we do broadcasting we use
29:17
um uh if it's Network layer we use 255 255 25
29:23
as the IP address if it's link layer we use 12 apps as the MAC address right
29:29
that's how we do the broadcasting and how could the switch now
29:34
um which outputting to choose to send we know the switch has a switch table and
29:41
how do we get the sweet table we use self learning right
29:47
um and also sometimes we know the IP address of the first home browser okay
29:52
or some computer some other IP address so then we need to know the MAC address
29:59
for that interface how do we know the MAC address we know we we can use ARP
30:05
query so you can see a lot of information is contained in this one complete story one scenario a lot of
30:14
information and I really hope I really hope you can go back to review what we have learned
30:22
today and kind of synthesize uh all the different layers and make this story
30:28
complete okay and then in the final exam I will definitely have a question about
30:34
this okay I'll be I will ask you what are the protocols used at each layer
30:41
um how do how does the sweet table be generated how is the switch table be
30:47
generated or how could the switch know which output link to send okay how do we do broadcasting okay or uh if you do not
30:56
know the IP address and how do you send this package to the
31:02
destination okay we know we have to do broadcasting sometimes so
31:07
uh and also I may ask you something about the ARP query so a lot of things I
31:13
will ask so really please review what we have learned today okay
